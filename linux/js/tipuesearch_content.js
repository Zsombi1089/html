It's relatively light on resources which makes it suitable for installation on older computers, giving them a new lease on life, as well as on newer systems. Navigating the applications menu and the file system is straightforward, intuitive and is similar to what many people coming from a Windows environment are used to. At the same time, XFCE offers a variety of ways for people to customize the look and feel of their desktop work environment to suit their own tastes if that is what they want to do. That is what this section of the manual is all about. If you get bored with the default setup, you can change it to your liking in a variety of ways. Linux Lite comes with a few themes and icon sets pre-installed already and switching to one of those is quick and easy. You can also download and apply other themes, icons and mouse pointers to your system if you'd like. The panel along the bottom of your screen that holds the Menu launcher and various indicator icons can be customized in a variety of ways too. In this section, we'll start off with the more basic ways to customize your desktop. (Over time, we may add examples to this page of additional programs that can be added to your system to spice things up a bit more.) Desktop Settings basics Some of the most basic changes people like to make are changing the desktop background (wallpaper), deciding whether or not to have certain icons show on the desktop and sometimes they may want to change something about the menu shown when right or middle clicking on the desktop. Desktop Settings is where to look for making those types of changes. There are two ways to access the Desktop Settings menu. One way is to simply right click on the desktop and choose Desktop Settings. Another way is to choose Desktop from the main Settings Manager window, which can be accessed by going to Menu, Settings, Settings Manager. First, we will look at the Background tab under Desktop Settings. By default, backgrounds are stored in the file system under the /usr/share/xfce4/backdrops folder. Images in that folder are shown as choices in the Background tab. Just click on the image you want and it will instantly switch to that for your background. If you want to add some of your own pictures to the choices, open your file manager As Administrator, enter your password, then navigate to that folder and paste your image into it. (HINT: You can just right click your desktop, choose Open as Administrator, enter your password and it will open the Thunar file manager at your Desktop folder. From there, just navigate to where your picture is stored, copy it, then navigate to /usr/share/xfce4/backdrops and paste it in.) If you prefer, you can change the folder location that the Background tab defaults to for choices. For example, if you have a folder called \"Wallpapers\" under your Home folder, you can tell the system to look there instead. Click the drop-down box next to the word Folder: and pick Other to navigate your way to /home/yourname/Wallpapers. Some people prefer doing this because it eliminates the need to be Administrator when adding new backgrounds. There are a few other options associated with the background images. You can choose from different styles to display them in, choose a background color if they do not cover the entire screen, have the backgrounds change after a certain amount of time and whether or not you want to have the same background on each workspace. If you decide to have a different background for each workspace, uncheck the Apply to all workspaces box, pick a wallpaper for the workspace you are on, then drag the window to another workspace and select a new wallpaper for it there. Now let's take a look at the Menu tab under Desktop Settings. Under Desktop Menu, it is asking if you want an applications menu to show up as a choice when you right click on the desktop and whether you want that menu to show the icons for the applications listed, or just their names. Lastly, under the Icons tab you can change various settings regarding the icons on the desktop - their size, whether to activate them with a single, or double click, etc. Under Default Icons you can choose whether or not to show certain default icons on the desktop. Top of page Workspace Settings If you are new to Linux, the concept of workspaces may be unfamiliar. Basically workspaces are virtual desktops that you can use to spread your work over. Linux Lite has two workspaces activated by default, but you can change that to any number you like. If you look to the right side of your lower panel you will notice two rectangles. Those are representations of your available workspaces as shown by the Workspaces plugin on the panel. Workspaces are particularly useful if you tend to have multiple programs open at the same time. For example, if you have two programs running in one workspace and want to open a few more, switching to another workspace gives you a fresh, clean desktop to put them on. This cuts down on desktop clutter and many find it easier to just switch workspaces rather than fumbling through multiple windows on the same desktop to find the one they want. Here are four screenshots that show the difference. First - three program windows opened on same workspace. Next - what you see when you switch to a new workspace. Last - Workspace 1 with only two programs kept on it. And - Workspace 2 with one program moved over to it. With your work spread out over more than one workspace everything is easier to see. Depending on your settings, switching between workspaces is typically done by either clicking one of the rectangles in the panel, using your mouse wheel while hovering over the rectangles, or using your mouse wheel on an empty spot of the desktop to scroll back and forth between workspaces. (Keyboard shortcuts can be used to switch workspaces also. These may vary depending on your keyboard layout, but a typical U.S. keyboard has Ctrl+Alt+ the Arrow Keys set to move between the workspaces.) There are three areas where workspace settings can be changed. You can right click the Workspaces plugin on the panel and choose Properties. That brings up the Workspace Switcher window. Some setting are found there and others appear when you subsequently click on Workspace Settings.... In the example below, we will set up four workspaces and have the Workspaces plugin display them in two rows instead of one on the panel. You can also go to the main Settings Manager, choose Workspaces there and that will allow you to change the number of workspaces, their names and margins (if desired). Lastly, there are some more workspace settings within the Window Manager Tweaks section. Top of page Lite Desktop Widget The Lite Desktop Widget is available in Linux Lite 3.2 and above. It's purpose is to give people a basic overview of their system running including: Linux Lite Version Date CPU usage - average cpu usage across all cores Memory Total - total memory installed Memory Usage - total memory currently in use User currently logged in Battery Status (laptops only) Firewall Status Updates Status The Lite Desktop Widget is disabled by default. Some people like this kind of information on their Desktop, some don't. To enable Lite Widget via the Settings Manager: Go to Menu, Settings, Settings Manager. Click on Lite Widget. Click on Enable Lite Widget. You'll get a confirmation pop-up and you will see Lite Widget appear in the bottom right hand corner of your screen (position may differ on multiple screens). Lite Widget will now start when your computer starts. To disable Lite Widget, just click on Disable Lite Widget. To enable Lite Widget via Session and Startup: Go to Menu, Settings, Session and Startup, Application Autostart and place a tick in Lite Widget. Logout then Login and the Widget will appear at the bottom right hand corner of your screen shortly after your Desktop has loaded. To disable the widget, untick Lite Widget. Logout then Login and the Widget will no longer appear. Updates Status - a reminder to Update your system There are 4 states of Updates Status. The Updates Status is refreshed once every 5 minutes, so once you have installed updates, it will take 5 minutes to display the new status in the widget. The widget does not display updates when they are available, it only shows when you last installed updates. For the Updates Status to accurately display available updates, this would require root access and each user would have to be added to the sudoers file, this is a huge security risk and will not be enabled. The first state appears when you complete a fresh install Linux Lite, it will read System never updated. It's at this time that you need to update your system. Go to Menu, Favorites, Install Updates to update your system. Once you have updated for the first time, after 5 minutes the Updates Status will change to Your system was recently updated. This message will also appear within the first hour, each time you update your system. The Lite Desktop Widget will then start displaying your Update Status every hour after the last update, as shown in the image below. The Lite Desktop Widget will then start displaying your Update Status every day after the last update, as shown in the image below. After the 3rd day, the Lite Desktop Widget will then start displaying your Update Status in yellow to remind you that it's time to update your system. After the 7th day, the Lite Desktop Widget will then start displaying your Update Status in red to remind you that it's time to update your system, urgently. Example of Firewall disabled status. Top of page Themes & Icon sets The default theme for Linux Lite is Adapta. The default icon set is Papirus-Adapta. There are some additional Theme and Icon sets in Linux Lite. Go to Menu, Settings, Settings Manager. There are 2 main areas in the Settings Manager that take care of these settings - Appearance and Window Manager. Click on Appearance. Here you will see the Style and Icons tab. As you click through the various themes and icon sets you will notice visual changes on your computer. Click All Settings to get back to the main Settings Manager window; then select Window Manager. The Style tab will display available themes that tweak the look of open window frames and the minimize/maximize/close buttons in the windows. Click through some of the choices to see how things change. Go back to the Appearance settings, pick a new theme, then come back to the Window Manager settings and go through choices again. You may notice that the Window Manager settings look slightly different depending on which Appearance theme you choose. Experiment with different combinations to find one you like. Close Settings Manager before moving onto the next part of this tutorial. This next section will show you how to apply new themes and icons. Top of page Applying a new Theme Head over to the XFCE Look website and choose theme of your liking. NOTE: Not all themes from there will work as you would expect. Please read all of the documentation before attempting to apply a new theme. Some make installation easy via a PPA, which is a preferable method to the one shown here. Click here for more information on how to install a new PPA. Whichever theme you choose, make sure that it mentions XFCE compatibility. The first thing we need to do is open up our home folder. Click on View, Show Hidden Files. Right click somewhere in your home folder, Create Folder, make a folder called .themes (you will only need to do this once). This is where we will copy the new theme to. Download a theme of your choosing. In this example we will choose the Axiom theme. NOTE: Each theme may come with a specific set of install instructions. If they do, please follow those instructions. Next, extract the theme you just downloaded (right click, Extract Here). Copy the Axiom themes folder to the .themes folders in your home folder. Now go to Menu, Settings, Settings Manager. There are 2 places we need to apply the new theme: Appearance and Window Manager. First, we'll click into Appearance. Select Axiom from the list. Click on All Settings in the bottom right to go back to the Settings Manager. Now click into Window Manager and select Axiom. The new theme may not display properly until you log out and back in again, so do that now. Click Menu, Log Out. Then log in again. After logging back in again, the theme is correctly applied. Top of page Applying a new Icon set Head over to the XFCE Look website and choose an Icon set of your liking. NOTE: Not all icon sets from there will work as you would expect. Please read all of the documentation before attempting to apply a new icon set. Some may make installation easy via a PPA, which is a preferable method to the one shown here. Click here for more information on how to install a new PPA. The first thing we need to do is open up our home folder. Click on View, Show Hidden Files. Right click somewhere in your home folder, Create Folder, make a folder called .icons (you will only need to do this once). This is where we will copy the new Icon set to. Download an icon set of your choosing. In this example we will choose the Zafiro Icon Set. NOTE: Each icon set may come with a specific set of install instructions. If they do, please follow those instructions. Next, extract the icon set you just downloaded (right click, Extract here). Copy the icon set folder to the .icons folder in your home folder. Open Settings Manager click into Appearance, Icons. Select Zafiro-icons from the list. Log out and then log in again to see your new icon theme. Top of page Applying a new Mouse (Cursors) theme Head over to the XFCE Look website and choose a Cursors theme of your liking. NOTE: Not all themes from there will work as you would expect. Please read all of the documentation before attempting to apply a new theme. Some make installation easy via a PPA, which is a preferable method to the one shown here. Click here for more information on how to install a new PPA. Whichever theme you choose, make sure that it mentions XFCE compatibility. The first thing we need to do is open up our home folder. Click on View, Show Hidden Files. Right click somewhere in your home folder, Create Folder, make a folder called .icons if it does not already exist. (You will only need to do this once). This is where we will copy the new theme to. Download a mouse theme of your choosing. In this example we will choose the Ecliz mouse theme. NOTE: Each icon set may come with a specific set of install instructions. If they do, please follow those instructions. Next, extract the icon set you just downloaded (right click, Extract here). Copy the extracted mouse theme folder to the .icons folder in your home folder. Then open the Settings Manager and open the Mouse and Touchpad settings. Click the Theme tab and you will find your new theme there. Click to select it and your mouse will immediately change. Top of page Customize your Panel Bar The panel bar along the bottom of your screen, (with your Menu and various indicator icons on it), can be customized in a variety of ways. Its position and size can be changed. Launchers and plugins can be added to it. You can even have multiple panels if you want to position certain items on different parts of the screen. To get started, right click on an empty area of the panel and select Panel, Panel Preferences. A Panel window will pop up where you can make your changes. The Display tab lets you choose to have the panel displayed horizontally, vertically, or as a deskbar on the screen. You can choose to auto-hide the panel or not, change its length and width and move it to the top, bottom, or either side of the screen. To move the panel you need to first unlock it, then you will see handles appear on either end of the panel that you can grab with your mouse to move it. Here is a close-up showing what the handles look like: The Appearance tab lets you choose a style for the panel, adjust the transparency (alpha) of the panel, or adjust the opacity of the panel depending on whether your mouse is pointing at it or not. (\"Compositing\" needs to be enabled in order to change transparency and opacity settings. See the Window Manager Tweaks section for how to do that.) The Items tab is where you go to add things like launchers, plugins and separators to the panel. Items on the panel are listed on the left and the buttons on the right allow you to change their position on the panel (up/down arrows), add (+) or delete (-) items, and edit details for them if necessary. As you do that, you can see the changes take immediate effect on the panel. Notice above that I created several launchers by using the + button, which opens an Add New Items window. That window is where you can choose to add launchers, separators, and plugins that are available for the panel. When you are done adding things, close the Add New Items window to get back to the Items tab of the Panel window. To assign a program to a launcher, highlight the launcher item and click the button for \"Edit the currently selected item\". That will bring up the Launcher window. Hit the + button to bring up a list of programs to choose from. As an example, below is a panel with the New Document launcher added. Creating a multi-level launcher, (giving you a choice to start more than one program from a single launcher), is done in the same manner as just described. The only difference is that you add more than one item to the same launcher. One might prefer to make a launcher menu instead of separate launchers to save space on the panel and/or to group similar types of programs. In our example, the New Document has a small arrow to the right of its icon. We'll add a New Spreadsheet launcher using the + button. Here is what the Launcher window looks like after adding the New Spreadsheet launcher. If you need a more detailed description of the procedure to create a multi-level launcher, please see this tutorial on our forum. The tutorial also describes some advanced tips like changing the position of the arrow on the launcher. Creating additional panels is easy to do. From the Panel Preferences window, click the + sign along the top next to the Panel 1 box. Now you will have a new (empty) panel showing on the desktop and the Panel Preferences window will show Panel 2 along the top. With Panel 2 showing, you can now go about setting your preferences for the new panel under the Display, Appearance and Items tabs. It is unlocked from the start so you can drag and place it where you like on the screen. There are many more panel plugins available for installation than those pre-installed with Linux Lite. Have a look on this XFCE site for a comprehensive list of panel plugins that are available in the repositories. They are listed with their real package names, so you can easily use the search function in the Synaptic Package Manager (found at Menu, System, Install/Remove Software) to find and install any that interest you. Top of page Window Manager Tweaks Select Window Manager Tweaks in the main Settings Manager window. Window Manager Tweaks are an assortment of other settings you can change that effect window behavior. They are organized under the tabs: Cycling, Focus, Accessibility, Workspaces, Placement and Compositor. We will just touch on a few of these settings here. The rest you can browse through at your leisure. The Compositor tab is of particular importance. It is here that you need to enable compositing if you plan to add transparency or opacity effects to your windows and/or panel(s). Check the box to Enable display compositing. Now you can access various transparency settings for windows as well as enable some shadow effects. Here is an example showing the opacity of inactive windows changed. Notice that the window in the background is now slightly faded. Back on Window Manager Tweaks, click on the Workspaces tab. Here you have a few more settings that control interacting with your workspaces. The options are pretty self explanatory. The last two options allow you to use your mouse to drag a window off one of the screen edges on to another workspace.

Its position and size can be changed. Launchers and plugins can be added to it. You can even have multiple panels if you want to position certain items on different parts of the screen. To get started, right click on an empty area of the panel and select Panel, Panel Preferences. A Panel window will pop up where you can make your changes. The Display tab lets you choose to have the panel displayed horizontally, vertically, or as a deskbar on the screen. You can choose to auto-hide the panel or not, change its length and width and move it to the top, bottom, or either side of the screen. To move the panel you need to first unlock it, then you will see handles appear on either end of the panel that you can grab with your mouse to move it. Here is a close-up showing what the handles look like: The Appearance tab lets you choose a style for the panel, adjust the transparency (alpha) of the panel, or adjust the opacity of the panel depending on whether your mouse is pointing at it or not. (\"Compositing\" needs to be enabled in order to change transparency and opacity settings. See the Window Manager Tweaks section for how to do that.) The Items tab is where you go to add things like launchers, plugins and separators to the panel. Items on the panel are listed on the left and the buttons on the right allow you to change their position on the panel (up/down arrows), add (+) or delete (-) items, and edit details for them if necessary. As you do that, you can see the changes take immediate effect on the panel. Notice above that I created several launchers by using the + button, which opens an Add New Items window. That window is where you can choose to add launchers, separators, and plugins that are available for the panel. When you are done adding things, close the Add New Items window to get back to the Items tab of the Panel window. To assign a program to a launcher, highlight the launcher item and click the button for \"Edit the currently selected item\". That will bring up the Launcher window. Hit the + button to bring up a list of programs to choose from. As an example, below is a panel with the New Document launcher added. Creating a multi-level launcher, (giving you a choice to start more than one program from a single launcher), is done in the same manner as just described. The only difference is that you add more than one item to the same launcher. One might prefer to make a launcher menu instead of separate launchers to save space on the panel and/or to group similar types of programs. In our example, the New Document has a small arrow to the right of its icon. We'll add a New Spreadsheet launcher using the + button. Here is what the Launcher window looks like after adding the New Spreadsheet launcher. If you need a more detailed description of the procedure to create a multi-level launcher, please see this tutorial on our forum. The tutorial also describes some advanced tips like changing the position of the arrow on the launcher. Creating additional panels is easy to do. From the Panel Preferences window, click the + sign along the top next to the Panel 1 box. Now you will have a new (empty) panel showing on the desktop and the Panel Preferences window will show Panel 2 along the top. With Panel 2 showing, you can now go about setting your preferences for the new panel under the Display, Appearance and Items tabs. It is unlocked from the start so you can drag and place it where you like on the screen. There are many more panel plugins available for installation than those pre-installed with Linux Lite. Have a look on this XFCE site for a comprehensive list of panel plugins that are available in the repositories. They are listed with their real package names, so you can easily use the search function in the Synaptic Package Manager (found at Menu, System, Install/Remove Software) to find and install any that interest you. Top of page Window Manager Tweaks Select Window Manager Tweaks in the main Settings Manager window. Window Manager Tweaks are an assortment of other settings you can change that effect window behavior. They are organized under the tabs: Cycling, Focus, Accessibility, Workspaces, Placement and Compositor. We will just touch on a few of these settings here. The rest you can browse through at your leisure. The Compositor tab is of particular importance. It is here that you need to enable compositing if you plan to add transparency or opacity effects to your windows and/or panel(s). Check the box to Enable display compositing. Now you can access various transparency settings for windows as well as enable some shadow effects. Here is an example showing the opacity of inactive windows changed. Notice that the window in the background is now slightly faded. Back on Window Manager Tweaks, click on the Workspaces tab. Here you have a few more settings that control interacting with your workspaces. The options are pretty self explanatory. The last two options allow you to use your mouse to drag a window off one of the screen edges on to another workspace.

It's relatively light on resources which makes it suitable for installation on older computers, giving them a new lease on life, as well as on newer systems. Navigating the applications menu and the file system is straightforward, intuitive and is similar to what many people coming from a Windows environment are used to. At the same time, XFCE offers a variety of ways for people to customize the look and feel of their desktop work environment to suit their own tastes if that is what they want to do. That is what this section of the manual is all about. If you get bored with the default setup, you can change it to your liking in a variety of ways. Linux Lite comes with a few themes and icon sets pre-installed already and switching to one of those is quick and easy. You can also download and apply other themes, icons and mouse pointers to your system if you'd like. The panel along the bottom of your screen that holds the Menu launcher and various indicator icons can be customized in a variety of ways too. In this section, we'll start off with the more basic ways to customize your desktop. (Over time, we may add examples to this page of additional programs that can be added to your system to spice things up a bit more.) Desktop Settings basics Some of the most basic changes people like to make are changing the desktop background (wallpaper), deciding whether or not to have certain icons show on the desktop and sometimes they may want to change something about the menu shown when right or middle clicking on the desktop. Desktop Settings is where to look for making those types of changes. There are two ways to access the Desktop Settings menu. One way is to simply right click on the desktop and choose Desktop Settings. Another way is to choose Desktop from the main Settings Manager window, which can be accessed by going to Menu, Settings, Settings Manager. First, we will look at the Background tab under Desktop Settings. By default, backgrounds are stored in the file system under the /usr/share/xfce4/backdrops folder. Images in that folder are shown as choices in the Background tab. Just click on the image you want and it will instantly switch to that for your background. If you want to add some of your own pictures to the choices, open your file manager As Administrator, enter your password, then navigate to that folder and paste your image into it. (HINT: You can just right click your desktop, choose Open as Administrator, enter your password and it will open the Thunar file manager at your Desktop folder. From there, just navigate to where your picture is stored, copy it, then navigate to /usr/share/xfce4/backdrops and paste it in.) If you prefer, you can change the folder location that the Background tab defaults to for choices. For example, if you have a folder called \"Wallpapers\" under your Home folder, you can tell the system to look there instead. Click the drop-down box next to the word Folder: and pick Other to navigate your way to /home/yourname/Wallpapers. Some people prefer doing this because it eliminates the need to be Administrator when adding new backgrounds. There are a few other options associated with the background images. You can choose from different styles to display them in, choose a background color if they do not cover the entire screen, have the backgrounds change after a certain amount of time and whether or not you want to have the same background on each workspace. If you decide to have a different background for each workspace, uncheck the Apply to all workspaces box, pick a wallpaper for the workspace you are on, then drag the window to another workspace and select a new wallpaper for it there. Now let's take a look at the Menu tab under Desktop Settings. Under Desktop Menu, it is asking if you want an applications menu to show up as a choice when you right click on the desktop and whether you want that menu to show the icons for the applications listed, or just their names. Lastly, under the Icons tab you can change various settings regarding the icons on the desktop - their size, whether to activate them with a single, or double click, etc. Under Default Icons you can choose whether or not to show certain default icons on the desktop. Top of page Workspace Settings If you are new to Linux, the concept of workspaces may be unfamiliar. Basically workspaces are virtual desktops that you can use to spread your work over. Linux Lite has two workspaces activated by default, but you can change that to any number you like. If you look to the right side of your lower panel you will notice two rectangles. Those are representations of your available workspaces as shown by the Workspaces plugin on the panel. Workspaces are particularly useful if you tend to have multiple programs open at the same time. For example, if you have two programs running in one workspace and want to open a few more, switching to another workspace gives you a fresh, clean desktop to put them on. This cuts down on desktop clutter and many find it easier to just switch workspaces rather than fumbling through multiple windows on the same desktop to find the one they want. Here are four screenshots that show the difference. First - three program windows opened on same workspace. Next - what you see when you switch to a new workspace. Last - Workspace 1 with only two programs kept on it. And - Workspace 2 with one program moved over to it. With your work spread out over more than one workspace everything is easier to see. Depending on your settings, switching between workspaces is typically done by either clicking one of the rectangles in the panel, using your mouse wheel while hovering over the rectangles, or using your mouse wheel on an empty spot of the desktop to scroll back and forth between workspaces. (Keyboard shortcuts can be used to switch workspaces also. These may vary depending on your keyboard layout, but a typical U.S. keyboard has Ctrl+Alt+ the Arrow Keys set to move between the workspaces.) There are three areas where workspace settings can be changed. You can right click the Workspaces plugin on the panel and choose Properties. That brings up the Workspace Switcher window. Some setting are found there and others appear when you subsequently click on Workspace Settings.... In the example below, we will set up four workspaces and have the Workspaces plugin display them in two rows instead of one on the panel. You can also go to the main Settings Manager, choose Workspaces there and that will allow you to change the number of workspaces, their names and margins (if desired). Lastly, there are some more workspace settings within the Window Manager Tweaks section. Top of page Lite Desktop Widget The Lite Desktop Widget is available in Linux Lite 3.2 and above. It's purpose is to give people a basic overview of their system running including: Linux Lite Version Date CPU usage - average cpu usage across all cores Memory Total - total memory installed Memory Usage - total memory currently in use User currently logged in Battery Status (laptops only) Firewall Status Updates Status The Lite Desktop Widget is disabled by default. Some people like this kind of information on their Desktop, some don't. To enable Lite Widget via the Settings Manager: Go to Menu, Settings, Settings Manager. Click on Lite Widget. Click on Enable Lite Widget. You'll get a confirmation pop-up and you will see Lite Widget appear in the bottom right hand corner of your screen (position may differ on multiple screens). Lite Widget will now start when your computer starts. To disable Lite Widget, just click on Disable Lite Widget. To enable Lite Widget via Session and Startup: Go to Menu, Settings, Session and Startup, Application Autostart and place a tick in Lite Widget. Logout then Login and the Widget will appear at the bottom right hand corner of your screen shortly after your Desktop has loaded. To disable the widget, untick Lite Widget. Logout then Login and the Widget will no longer appear. Updates Status - a reminder to Update your system There are 4 states of Updates Status. The Updates Status is refreshed once every 5 minutes, so once you have installed updates, it will take 5 minutes to display the new status in the widget. The widget does not display updates when they are available, it only shows when you last installed updates. For the Updates Status to accurately display available updates, this would require root access and each user would have to be added to the sudoers file, this is a huge security risk and will not be enabled. The first state appears when you complete a fresh install Linux Lite, it will read System never updated. It's at this time that you need to update your system. Go to Menu, Favorites, Install Updates to update your system. Once you have updated for the first time, after 5 minutes the Updates Status will change to Your system was recently updated. This message will also appear within the first hour, each time you update your system. The Lite Desktop Widget will then start displaying your Update Status every hour after the last update, as shown in the image below. The Lite Desktop Widget will then start displaying your Update Status every day after the last update, as shown in the image below. After the 3rd day, the Lite Desktop Widget will then start displaying your Update Status in yellow to remind you that it's time to update your system. After the 7th day, the Lite Desktop Widget will then start displaying your Update Status in red to remind you that it's time to update your system, urgently. Example of Firewall disabled status. Top of page Themes & Icon sets The default theme for Linux Lite is Adapta. The default icon set is Papirus-Adapta. There are some additional Theme and Icon sets in Linux Lite. Go to Menu, Settings, Settings Manager. There are 2 main areas in the Settings Manager that take care of these settings - Appearance and Window Manager. Click on Appearance. Here you will see the Style and Icons tab. As you click through the various themes and icon sets you will notice visual changes on your computer. Click All Settings to get back to the main Settings Manager window; then select Window Manager. The Style tab will display available themes that tweak the look of open window frames and the minimize/maximize/close buttons in the windows. Click through some of the choices to see how things change. Go back to the Appearance settings, pick a new theme, then come back to the Window Manager settings and go through choices again. You may notice that the Window Manager settings look slightly different depending on which Appearance theme you choose. Experiment with different combinations to find one you like. Close Settings Manager before moving onto the next part of this tutorial. This next section will show you how to apply new themes and icons. Top of page Applying a new Theme Head over to the XFCE Look website and choose theme of your liking. NOTE: Not all themes from there will work as you would expect. Please read all of the documentation before attempting to apply a new theme. Some make installation easy via a PPA, which is a preferable method to the one shown here. Click here for more information on how to install a new PPA. Whichever theme you choose, make sure that it mentions XFCE compatibility. The first thing we need to do is open up our home folder. Click on View, Show Hidden Files. Right click somewhere in your home folder, Create Folder, make a folder called .themes (you will only need to do this once). This is where we will copy the new theme to. Download a theme of your choosing. In this example we will choose the Axiom theme. NOTE: Each theme may come with a specific set of install instructions. If they do, please follow those instructions. Next, extract the theme you just downloaded (right click, Extract Here). Copy the Axiom themes folder to the .themes folders in your home folder. Now go to Menu, Settings, Settings Manager. There are 2 places we need to apply the new theme: Appearance and Window Manager. First, we'll click into Appearance. Select Axiom from the list. Click on All Settings in the bottom right to go back to the Settings Manager. Now click into Window Manager and select Axiom. The new theme may not display properly until you log out and back in again, so do that now. Click Menu, Log Out. Then log in again. After logging back in again, the theme is correctly applied.

Please read all of the documentation before attempting to apply a new theme. Some make installation easy via a PPA, which is a preferable method to the one shown here. Click here for more information on how to install a new PPA. Whichever theme you choose, make sure that it mentions XFCE compatibility. The first thing we need to do is open up our home folder. Click on View, Show Hidden Files. Right click somewhere in your home folder, Create Folder, make a folder called .themes (you will only need to do this once). This is where we will copy the new theme to. Download a theme of your choosing. In this example we will choose the Axiom theme. NOTE: Each theme may come with a specific set of install instructions. If they do, please follow those instructions. Next, extract the theme you just downloaded (right click, Extract Here). Copy the Axiom themes folder to the .themes folders in your home folder. Now go to Menu, Settings, Settings Manager. There are 2 places we need to apply the new theme: Appearance and Window Manager. First, we'll click into Appearance. Select Axiom from the list. Click on All Settings in the bottom right to go back to the Settings Manager. Now click into Window Manager and select Axiom. The new theme may not display properly until you log out and back in again, so do that now. Click Menu, Log Out. Then log in again. After logging back in again, the theme is correctly applied. Top of page Applying a new Icon set Head over to the XFCE Look website and choose an Icon set of your liking. NOTE: Not all icon sets from there will work as you would expect. Please read all of the documentation before attempting to apply a new icon set. Some may make installation easy via a PPA, which is a preferable method to the one shown here. Click here for more information on how to install a new PPA. The first thing we need to do is open up our home folder. Click on View, Show Hidden Files. Right click somewhere in your home folder, Create Folder, make a folder called .icons (you will only need to do this once). This is where we will copy the new Icon set to. Download an icon set of your choosing. In this example we will choose the Zafiro Icon Set. NOTE: Each icon set may come with a specific set of install instructions. If they do, please follow those instructions. Next, extract the icon set you just downloaded (right click, Extract here). Copy the icon set folder to the .icons folder in your home folder. Open Settings Manager click into Appearance, Icons. Select Zafiro-icons from the list. Log out and then log in again to see your new icon theme. Top of page Applying a new Mouse (Cursors) theme Head over to the XFCE Look website and choose a Cursors theme of your liking. NOTE: Not all themes from there will work as you would expect. Please read all of the documentation before attempting to apply a new theme. Some make installation easy via a PPA, which is a preferable method to the one shown here. Click here for more information on how to install a new PPA. Whichever theme you choose, make sure that it mentions XFCE compatibility. The first thing we need to do is open up our home folder. Click on View, Show Hidden Files. Right click somewhere in your home folder, Create Folder, make a folder called .icons if it does not already exist. (You will only need to do this once). This is where we will copy the new theme to. Download a mouse theme of your choosing. In this example we will choose the Ecliz mouse theme. NOTE: Each icon set may come with a specific set of install instructions. If they do, please follow those instructions. Next, extract the icon set you just downloaded (right click, Extract here). Copy the extracted mouse theme folder to the .icons folder in your home folder. Then open the Settings Manager and open the Mouse and Touchpad settings. Click the Theme tab and you will find your new theme there. Click to select it and your mouse will immediately change. Top of page Customize your Panel Bar The panel bar along the bottom of your screen, (with your Menu and various indicator icons on it), can be customized in a variety of ways. Its position and size can be changed. Launchers and plugins can be added to it. You can even have multiple panels if you want to position certain items on different parts of the screen. To get started, right click on an empty area of the panel and select Panel, Panel Preferences. A Panel window will pop up where you can make your changes. The Display tab lets you choose to have the panel displayed horizontally, vertically, or as a deskbar on the screen. You can choose to auto-hide the panel or not, change its length and width and move it to the top, bottom, or either side of the screen. To move the panel you need to first unlock it, then you will see handles appear on either end of the panel that you can grab with your mouse to move it. Here is a close-up showing what the handles look like: The Appearance tab lets you choose a style for the panel, adjust the transparency (alpha) of the panel, or adjust the opacity of the panel depending on whether your mouse is pointing at it or not. (\"Compositing\" needs to be enabled in order to change transparency and opacity settings. See the Window Manager Tweaks section for how to do that.) The Items tab is where you go to add things like launchers, plugins and separators to the panel. Items on the panel are listed on the left and the buttons on the right allow you to change their position on the panel (up/down arrows), add (+) or delete (-) items, and edit details for them if necessary. As you do that, you can see the changes take immediate effect on the panel. Notice above that I created several launchers by using the + button, which opens an Add New Items window. That window is where you can choose to add launchers, separators, and plugins that are available for the panel. When you are done adding things, close the Add New Items window to get back to the Items tab of the Panel window. To assign a program to a launcher, highlight the launcher item and click the button for \"Edit the currently selected item\". That will bring up the Launcher window. Hit the + button to bring up a list of programs to choose from. As an example, below is a panel with the New Document launcher added. Creating a multi-level launcher, (giving you a choice to start more than one program from a single launcher), is done in the same manner as just described. The only difference is that you add more than one item to the same launcher. One might prefer to make a launcher menu instead of separate launchers to save space on the panel and/or to group similar types of programs. In our example, the New Document has a small arrow to the right of its icon. We'll add a New Spreadsheet launcher using the + button. Here is what the Launcher window looks like after adding the New Spreadsheet launcher. If you need a more detailed description of the procedure to create a multi-level launcher, please see this tutorial on our forum. The tutorial also describes some advanced tips like changing the position of the arrow on the launcher. Creating additional panels is easy to do. From the Panel Preferences window, click the + sign along the top next to the Panel 1 box. Now you will have a new (empty) panel showing on the desktop and the Panel Preferences window will show Panel 2 along the top. With Panel 2 showing, you can now go about setting your preferences for the new panel under the Display, Appearance and Items tabs. It is unlocked from the start so you can drag and place it where you like on the screen. There are many more panel plugins available for installation than those pre-installed with Linux Lite. Have a look on this XFCE site for a comprehensive list of panel plugins that are available in the repositories. They are listed with their real package names, so you can easily use the search function in the Synaptic Package Manager (found at Menu, System, Install/Remove Software) to find and install any that interest you. Top of page Window Manager Tweaks Select Window Manager Tweaks in the main Settings Manager window. Window Manager Tweaks are an assortment of other settings you can change that effect window behavior. They are organized under the tabs: Cycling, Focus, Accessibility, Workspaces, Placement and Compositor. We will just touch on a few of these settings here. The rest you can browse through at your leisure. The Compositor tab is of particular importance. It is here that you need to enable compositing if you plan to add transparency or opacity effects to your windows and/or panel(s). Check the box to Enable display compositing. Now you can access various transparency settings for windows as well as enable some shadow effects. Here is an example showing the opacity of inactive windows changed. Notice that the window in the background is now slightly faded. Back on Window Manager Tweaks, click on the Workspaces tab. Here you have a few more settings that control interacting with your workspaces. The options are pretty self explanatory. The last two options allow you to use your mouse to drag a window off one of the screen edges on to another workspace.

It's relatively light on resources which makes it suitable for installation on older computers, giving them a new lease on life, as well as on newer systems. Navigating the applications menu and the file system is straightforward, intuitive and is similar to what many people coming from a Windows environment are used to. At the same time, XFCE offers a variety of ways for people to customize the look and feel of their desktop work environment to suit their own tastes if that is what they want to do. That is what this section of the manual is all about. If you get bored with the default setup, you can change it to your liking in a variety of ways. Linux Lite comes with a few themes and icon sets pre-installed already and switching to one of those is quick and easy. You can also download and apply other themes, icons and mouse pointers to your system if you'd like. The panel along the bottom of your screen that holds the Menu launcher and various indicator icons can be customized in a variety of ways too. In this section, we'll start off with the more basic ways to customize your desktop. (Over time, we may add examples to this page of additional programs that can be added to your system to spice things up a bit more.) Desktop Settings basics Some of the most basic changes people like to make are changing the desktop background (wallpaper), deciding whether or not to have certain icons show on the desktop and sometimes they may want to change something about the menu shown when right or middle clicking on the desktop. Desktop Settings is where to look for making those types of changes. There are two ways to access the Desktop Settings menu. One way is to simply right click on the desktop and choose Desktop Settings. Another way is to choose Desktop from the main Settings Manager window, which can be accessed by going to Menu, Settings, Settings Manager. First, we will look at the Background tab under Desktop Settings. By default, backgrounds are stored in the file system under the /usr/share/xfce4/backdrops folder. Images in that folder are shown as choices in the Background tab. Just click on the image you want and it will instantly switch to that for your background. If you want to add some of your own pictures to the choices, open your file manager As Administrator, enter your password, then navigate to that folder and paste your image into it. (HINT: You can just right click your desktop, choose Open as Administrator, enter your password and it will open the Thunar file manager at your Desktop folder. From there, just navigate to where your picture is stored, copy it, then navigate to /usr/share/xfce4/backdrops and paste it in.) If you prefer, you can change the folder location that the Background tab defaults to for choices. For example, if you have a folder called \"Wallpapers\" under your Home folder, you can tell the system to look there instead. Click the drop-down box next to the word Folder: and pick Other to navigate your way to /home/yourname/Wallpapers. Some people prefer doing this because it eliminates the need to be Administrator when adding new backgrounds. There are a few other options associated with the background images. You can choose from different styles to display them in, choose a background color if they do not cover the entire screen, have the backgrounds change after a certain amount of time and whether or not you want to have the same background on each workspace. If you decide to have a different background for each workspace, uncheck the Apply to all workspaces box, pick a wallpaper for the workspace you are on, then drag the window to another workspace and select a new wallpaper for it there. Now let's take a look at the Menu tab under Desktop Settings. Under Desktop Menu, it is asking if you want an applications menu to show up as a choice when you right click on the desktop and whether you want that menu to show the icons for the applications listed, or just their names. Lastly, under the Icons tab you can change various settings regarding the icons on the desktop - their size, whether to activate them with a single, or double click, etc. Under Default Icons you can choose whether or not to show certain default icons on the desktop. Top of page Workspace Settings If you are new to Linux, the concept of workspaces may be unfamiliar. Basically workspaces are virtual desktops that you can use to spread your work over. Linux Lite has two workspaces activated by default, but you can change that to any number you like. If you look to the right side of your lower panel you will notice two rectangles. Those are representations of your available workspaces as shown by the Workspaces plugin on the panel. Workspaces are particularly useful if you tend to have multiple programs open at the same time. For example, if you have two programs running in one workspace and want to open a few more, switching to another workspace gives you a fresh, clean desktop to put them on. This cuts down on desktop clutter and many find it easier to just switch workspaces rather than fumbling through multiple windows on the same desktop to find the one they want. Here are four screenshots that show the difference. First - three program windows opened on same workspace. Next - what you see when you switch to a new workspace. Last - Workspace 1 with only two programs kept on it. And - Workspace 2 with one program moved over to it. With your work spread out over more than one workspace everything is easier to see. Depending on your settings, switching between workspaces is typically done by either clicking one of the rectangles in the panel, using your mouse wheel while hovering over the rectangles, or using your mouse wheel on an empty spot of the desktop to scroll back and forth between workspaces. (Keyboard shortcuts can be used to switch workspaces also. These may vary depending on your keyboard layout, but a typical U.S. keyboard has Ctrl+Alt+ the Arrow Keys set to move between the workspaces.) There are three areas where workspace settings can be changed. You can right click the Workspaces plugin on the panel and choose Properties. That brings up the Workspace Switcher window. Some setting are found there and others appear when you subsequently click on Workspace Settings.... In the example below, we will set up four workspaces and have the Workspaces plugin display them in two rows instead of one on the panel. You can also go to the main Settings Manager, choose Workspaces there and that will allow you to change the number of workspaces, their names and margins (if desired). Lastly, there are some more workspace settings within the Window Manager Tweaks section. Top of page Lite Desktop Widget The Lite Desktop Widget is available in Linux Lite 3.2 and above. It's purpose is to give people a basic overview of their system running including: The Lite Desktop Widget is disabled by default. Some people like this kind of information on their Desktop, some don't. To enable Lite Widget via the Settings Manager: Go to Menu, Settings, Settings Manager. Click on Lite Widget. Click on Enable Lite Widget. You'll get a confirmation pop-up and you will see Lite Widget appear in the bottom right hand corner of your screen (position may differ on multiple screens). Lite Widget will now start when your computer starts. To disable Lite Widget, just click on Disable Lite Widget. To enable Lite Widget via Session and Startup: Go to Menu, Settings, Session and Startup, Application Autostart and place a tick in Lite Widget. Logout then Login and the Widget will appear at the bottom right hand corner of your screen shortly after your Desktop has loaded. To disable the widget, untick Lite Widget. Logout then Login and the Widget will no longer appear. Updates Status - a reminder to Update your system There are 4 states of Updates Status. The Updates Status is refreshed once every 5 minutes, so once you have installed updates, it will take 5 minutes to display the new status in the widget. The widget does not display updates when they are available, it only shows when you last installed updates. For the Updates Status to accurately display available updates, this would require root access and each user would have to be added to the sudoers file, this is a huge security risk and will not be enabled. The first state appears when you complete a fresh install Linux Lite, it will read System never updated. It's at this time that you need to update your system. Go to Menu, Favorites, Install Updates to update your system. Once you have updated for the first time, after 5 minutes the Updates Status will change to Your system was recently updated. This message will also appear within the first hour, each time you update your system. The Lite Desktop Widget will then start displaying your Update Status every hour after the last update, as shown in the image below. The Lite Desktop Widget will then start displaying your Update Status every day after the last update, as shown in the image below. After the 3rd day, the Lite Desktop Widget will then start displaying your Update Status in yellow to remind you that it's time to update your system. After the 7th day, the Lite Desktop Widget will then start displaying your Update Status in red to remind you that it's time to update your system, urgently. Example of Firewall disabled status. Top of page Themes & Icon sets The default theme for Linux Lite is Adapta. The default icon set is Papirus-Adapta. There are some additional Theme and Icon sets in Linux Lite. Go to Menu, Settings, Settings Manager. There are 2 main areas in the Settings Manager that take care of these settings - Appearance and Window Manager. Click on Appearance. Here you will see the Style and Icons tab. As you click through the various themes and icon sets you will notice visual changes on your computer. Click All Settings to get back to the main Settings Manager window; then select Window Manager. The Style tab will display available themes that tweak the look of open window frames and the minimize/maximize/close buttons in the windows. Click through some of the choices to see how things change. Go back to the Appearance settings, pick a new theme, then come back to the Window Manager settings and go through choices again. You may notice that the Window Manager settings look slightly different depending on which Appearance theme you choose. Experiment with different combinations to find one you like. Close Settings Manager before moving onto the next part of this tutorial. This next section will show you how to apply new themes and icons. Top of page Applying a new Theme Head over to the XFCE Look website and choose theme of your liking. NOTE: Not all themes from there will work as you would expect.

Check out our Hardware Database here to see if your model is already listed. Don't forget you can also run Linux Lite live before you install it to see if your hardware is supported. This database feature is new so the list of computers at the moment is limited. If you already have Linux Lite installed, please consider adding your hardware to the Linux Lite Hardware Database to help others. Graphics Drivers and Setup Legacy Binary Drivers and Proprietary Binary Drivers Legacy binary driver - a driver for older video cards no longer supported by the current driver. Proprietary binary driver - a driver for newer video cards. If you're not sure whether your video chipset/card needs a legacy binary driver or a proprietary binary driver, please select from the following links for nVidia and AMD: nVidia Legacy information - If your card is listed here, you can either use the pre-installed video driver for Linux Lite or you can try the legacy driver. Linux Lite recommends you stick with the pre-installed video driver as it is the most reliable, and the safest choice. AMD Legacy information - Linux Lite recommends you stick with the pre-installed video driver as it is the most reliable, and the safest choice. Graphics - AMD Radeon NOTE: The newest Linux Lite is based on Ubuntu 22.04 'Jammy' and therefore cannot provide the AMDGPU proprietary drivers. This is something that is out of our control. If you want to use the AMDGPU proprietary drivers, there are advanced tutorials available online. Please note that we cannot provide support for the AMDGPU proprietary drivers. If you have an AMD graphics card, there is no need to install any graphics drivers in the Linux Lite Series, 5x, 6x. The open source drivers are already pre-installed. The following AMDGPU products are supported via a collection of pre-installed open source drivers in Linux Lite: R100, RV100, RS100, RV200, RS200, RS250, R200, RV250, RV280, RS300, RS350, RS400/RS480, R300, R350, R360, RV350, RV360, RV370, RV380, RV410, R420, R423/R430, R480/R481, RV505/RV515/RV516/RV550, R520, RV530/RV560, RV570/R580, RS600/RS690/RS740, R600, RV610/RV630, RV620/RV635, RV670, RS780/RS880, RV710/RV730, RV740/RV770/RV790, CEDAR, REDWOOD, JUNIPER, CYPRESS, HEMLOCK, PALM, SUMO/SUMO2, BARTS, TURKS, CAICOS, CAYMAN, ARUBA, TAHITI, PITCAIRN, VERDE, OLAND, HAINAN, BONAIRE, KABINI, MULLINS, KAVERI, HAWAII. As well as many legacy (older) ATI/AMD video cards including, but not limited to: ATI Rage 'r128' series, ATI Mach64 series and legacy AMD/ATI Mach64, Rage128, Radeon, FireGL, FireMV, FirePro, FireStream video cards. Top of page Graphics - NVIDIA If you're not sure if your graphics card is nVidia or not, open up a terminal and run this command: Terminal Command: sudo lshw -C display You see under product: nVidia or GeForce (and similar naming schemes for nVidia cards) depending on your card. The vendor: line may also show you the Product or Company name. NOTE: You must be connected to the internet before you start the driver install. The next step is to go to Menu, Settings, Install Drivers. The program will then scan your computer for any drivers that you may need, this may take some time. When it has finished scanning, you will see a dialogue box similar to the one below. Generally you will want to select the current version, the tested driver. In the above example we selected the Using NVIDIA binary driver (proprietary, tested). NOTE: If you plan to play graphic intensive games or you have a lot of Steam games, you need to select the proprietary, tested driver. Now click on Apply Changes. You will be prompted for your password: You will see the following dialog as it downloads and installs: When the driver has finished, restart your computer. Now head over to Menu, System, NVIDIA X Server Settings. Once you open NVIDIA X Server Settings, you will have a number of options to select as well as some technical data to look over. Top of page Graphics - NVIDIA Prime This method should ONLY be used if the above nVidia install method does not give you Prime options in the Nvidia Settings Manager. From a fresh install of Linux Lite, open up a terminal and type: Terminal Command: sudo apt-get update To install the recommended driver, run the following command: Terminal Command: sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall Now restart your computer. Top of page Dual Monitor Setup Instructions If you have two monitors, they will start out 'mirroring' the same displayed output. To get the monitors to act as one large area allowing you to spread your work out separately on each, you can now do that easily through the GUI Settings Manager instead of through terminal commands and manually editing configuration files. Go to Menu, Settings, Settings Manager. Click on Display under the Hardware category. Initially, both monitors will have the Mirror displays box checked. Click on the first monitor listed on the left and un-check Mirror displays on the right. Repeat the procedure for the second monitor. Drag and drop each screen to where you want them to be arranged. Click Apply when you are finished. Once they are no longer mirrored, you may see that one of them is missing the desktop wallpaper and the lower panel only spans one of them. Click All Settings to go back to the main Settings Manager window and choose Desktop under the Personal category. Whichever monitor the Desktop settings window is on, that is the one it will apply to. Drag it over to the monitor that is blank and notice how the monitor description changes according to which one it is on. When you drag the Display settings window over to another monitor, the wallpaper that was highlighted on the one you dragged from stays highlighted, but no change will take effect on the second monitor until you actually click on one of the wallpapers. You may set a different wallpaper for each monitor. If you want one picture to span across both screens, set the second screen to None in the Style drop down box. (Remember - you need to have the Desktop settings window positioned on the second monitor to do this.) Then move the Desktop settings window back to the monitor with the wallpaper displayed and select Spanning screens from the Style drop down box. Now, you will have wallpaper spanning across both screens; but you still have the panel stuck on only one of them. To get your panel to also span both monitors, go back to the main Settings Manager window and choose Panel under the Personal category. In the Panel settings window, click on the box next to Span Monitors. Congratulations, you have successfully set up and configured dual monitors. Top of page Sound Configuration The audio icon can be found in the lower right hand corner, commonly referred to as the system tray. Left click on the speaker icon. You can drag the main slider to the left or right to control main volume. Now click on Audio Mixer. You will be brought to a window similar to this one. In the window above you can adjust volume settings for output. Using the sliding bars. You can toggle mute with the speaker icon: It will change it's background color when active: You can lock channels using: so that when volume is raised or lowered it is done equally. Or you can toggle and set the volume to be louder on one side. This icon: is used to specify the default device used by PulseAudio. Playback - will list programs currently producing audio, or able to. You can toggle access per program and or adjust volume per program here. The method used is the same as mentioned above. Recording - will list programs currently using an input method, be it line-in or a microphone. You can toggle access per program and or adjust volume per program here. The method used is the same as mentioned above. Output Devices - is for main configuration of sound levels across your system. Input Devices - this includes microphones and other line-in devices, such as TV tuner cards with line in. Adjusting the levels and settings are the same method as described above. Configuration - this lists known profiles for your sound card. In most cases there is no need to select anything here unless you intend to disable your sound completely, or have a unique profile setting, such as surround sound, mono, or stereo out. Notes: Being able to toggle on mute and unmute on multiple things can cause issues. And at times the device may be muted upon install. Show caution here as you may mute a certain program and forget about it entirely. If unmuting and adjusting settings for your sound card and related programs do not work at all, there may be a driver issue. Refer below for resources on how to remedy this. You can find help by using the Lite System Report tool and using the directions to upload the generated report to the Forums. Volume Toggles Here, we will show you how to set keyboard shortcuts for Volume + Volume - and Mute Volume. Providing you are not already using the hot keys on a supported multimedia keyboard, the following is an excellent replacement. First step is to right click on the Volume icon in the tray, select Properties and ensure Enable keyboard shortcuts for volume control is ticked. 1. Next click on Menu, Settings, Keyboard and click on the Applications Shortcuts tab. 2. Next click on the Add button and paste in the following: pactl -- set-sink-volume 0 +10% 3. Click Ok and then hold down the Right Alt key and the =/+ near the top of your keyboard. Now Right Alt plus =/+ is set to raise the main volume. 4. To set a toggle to lower the volume by 10% each time, repeat steps 1 -3 above but this time to lower the volume, enter this command: pactl -- set-sink-volume 0 -10% 5. This time hold down the Right Alt key and the -/_ near the top of your keyboard (next to the =/+ button). Now Right Alt plus -/_ is set to lower the main volume. 6. To set a toggle to mute the volume repeat steps 1 -3 above but this time to mute the volume, enter this command: pactl -- set-sink-mute 0 toggle 7. This time hold down the Right Alt key and the M on your keyboard. Now Right Alt plus M is set to mute the main volume. Now all 3 volume toggles have been set, try them out.

Make sure the printer connected to Linux Lite and is fully operational, drivers installed and set up. Temporarily disable the Linux Lite Firewall, see here. After you are able to print from Windows to a Linux Lite shared printer, we will enable it again and create the correct rule for it. Firewall blocking services is usually overlooked. Click on Menu, System, Printers. Select (highlight) your Printer and select from the menu Printer, Shared. Then, considering this is a home network and that you want to make your life as easy as possible, let's allow quite a few options in Server Settings. Open Server, Settings and configure as shown below: That's all there is on your Linux Lite side. Now let's go to your Windows 10 machine to connect to the shared printer. Before going into Windows, make sure you know the correct name of your printer. For example, my printer name is Samsung-ML-2550 (case sensitive). This is the name you define when adding the printer to Linux Lite. You do not want to have spaces in the name and also understand that lower case and UPPER case do make a difference in Linux. So, with that said, in Windows 10: Devices and Printers -> Add a printer - The printer that I want isn't listed. Select a shared printer by name. The printer can the be added using the hostname or the IP address of your Linux Lite PC on port 631. To keep it simple, in case you do not have DNS resolution in your local network, you will use the IP address of your Linux Lite PC, as shown below: http://[LINUX LITE PC IP]:631/printers/[YOUR PRINTER'S CASE SENSITIVE NAME] From there, just select the brand and model for your printer as you usually do in Windows... and you should be able to print thereafter. Once you can print from Windows, you can re-enable your firewall and use the firewall tutorial section to add CUPS as a Service, and allow port 631 for both TCP and UDP eg.

More information can be found here - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair Top of page Installation Issues No Option to Install Alongside Windows? If this happens, it usually means that Windows is already using four partitions on the hard drive, which is the limit for BIOS based computers using traditional MBR type partitions. (Newer computers may that use UEFI firmware may use GPT partitioned drives that do not have the 4 partition limit. This discussion does not get into that.) You will need to either eliminate one of the current partitions, or add another hard drive to the computer for installing Linux Lite. If you are unfamiliar with partitioning, it would be best to make a post on the Forums for help before proceeding. Generally speaking, in this situation there is may be a partition set aside where the manufacture has put copies of drivers and other extras that were part of the initial installation. There may also be a recovery partition that gets used for reinstalling Windows in the event that is needed. If you went through the process of creating a recovery USB or set of recovery DVD's, then you can probably get rid of the recovery partition. Same goes for the partition set aside for manufacturer installed drivers and extras, if you made a copy of that. Once one or both of those partitions has been deleted, you may also need to shrink the main (largest) Windows partition (probably labeled as \"C: drive\"). If you have the space, ideally you should try to allocate 50-100GB for Linux Lite. (It will be fine with +/-15GB; but you won't have much room for expansion). Before shrinking any partition, be sure to defragment the partition in Windows first. Then shrink the partition and leave the free space as it is, un-partitioned. Do not create Linux partitions with Windows disk manager. It is best done using Linux tools. At that point, you can go ahead and run the installer again and it should now offer the choice to install \"Alongside Windows\". If it needs to it will create an \"extended\" partition that will serve as a container for the \"logical\" partitions needed for the installation. (That is a way that is commonly used to get around the 4-partition maximum rule. As long as only 3 partitions are \"primary\", an extended partition can be used to house multiple logical partitions within it - thus giving you the ability to have more than four partitions.) Does Your Newer Computer Use UEFI Firmware for Booting? If you have a newer model computer with UEFI firmware, it may allow for two modes of booting: UEFI/EFI-mode or BIOS/CSM/Legacy-mode. There is a good chance that Windows is installed to the hard drive in UEFI-mode. In that case it will also be using the newer GPT partitioning scheme on the hard drive. (This applies mainly to Windows 8, but some versions of Windows 7 may be installed that way too.) You need to confirm for sure which way Windows is installed before attempting the Linux Lite installation. The first thing to check is whether or not you are using a 64-bit version of Windows. You should be able to find that out by going to the \"System\" section from the \"Control Panel\". If you find that it is a 32-bit version, then you will be able to install Linux Lite. (Only 64-bit versions of Windows currently support UEFI booting.) If you have a 64-bit version of Windows, it could be installed in either BIOS/Legacy-mode or in UEFI-mode; so you will need to investigate further. Go to Windows disk management and take a look at the partitions on the hard drive. If you see a small partition near the beginning of the drive, formatted as FAT32, labeled along the lines of \"System\" or \"EFI System Partition\", then you have a UEFI installation of Windows and will not be able to properly install Linux Lite. If you don't see that partition, then you should have an MBR-partitioned disk and you can install Linux Lite. If you need help figuring that out, take a screenshot of your hard drive partitions and post that to the Forums with your inquiry. Dual Boot Install on Systems with More Than One Hard Drive? When choosing to install Linux Lite alongside Windows on a computer with more than one hard drive, the default action of the installer is to install the Linux boot loader to the MBR of the first hard drive. Since Windows is likely installed to the first drive, its boot loader will be replaced on the MBR with the Linux boot loader. The Linux boot loader will see the Windows installation and add it to the boot menu on start-up. This is how most people do the installation. However, some people prefer to keep the Windows boot loader intact on its own drive and install the Linux boot loader to its own drive. (There are various reasons for doing that, the most common being that it makes booting Windows easier if they decide to remove the Linux installation.) After the installation completes, they then set the computer's BIOS to boot from the Linux drive. Even though the Linux boot loader is installed to a separate drive, it will see the Windows installation and add a boot choice for it. By booting from the Linux drive, you get the choice to boot either OS. If you later remove Linux, simply reset the BIOS to boot from the Windows drive and it will boot Windows as it did before your installation of Linux. To accomplish this, you must choose the \"Something else\" option from the \"Installation Type\" screen during installation. On the following screen you will set-up your partitions and mount points manually. Then, near the bottom of the window, you need to set the \"location for boot loader installation\" to the MBR of the drive containing Linux Lite. For example, if you had two hard drives - /dev/sda (Windows) and /dev/sdb (Linux) - you would set the location to /dev/sdb (without any partition number at the end). If you are not experienced with partitioning, or are unsure about how to proceed, post on our Forums for assistance.

Top of page Dual Monitor Setup Instructions If you have two monitors, they will start out 'mirroring' the same displayed output. To get the monitors to act as one large area allowing you to spread your work out separately on each, you can now do that easily through the GUI Settings Manager instead of through terminal commands and manually editing configuration files. Go to Menu, Settings, Settings Manager. Click on Display under the Hardware category. Initially, both monitors will have the Mirror displays box checked. Click on the first monitor listed on the left and un-check Mirror displays on the right. Repeat the procedure for the second monitor. Drag and drop each screen to where you want them to be arranged. Click Apply when you are finished. Once they are no longer mirrored, you may see that one of them is missing the desktop wallpaper and the lower panel only spans one of them. Click All Settings to go back to the main Settings Manager window and choose Desktop under the Personal category. Whichever monitor the Desktop settings window is on, that is the one it will apply to. Drag it over to the monitor that is blank and notice how the monitor description changes according to which one it is on. When you drag the Display settings window over to another monitor, the wallpaper that was highlighted on the one you dragged from stays highlighted, but no change will take effect on the second monitor until you actually click on one of the wallpapers. You may set a different wallpaper for each monitor. If you want one picture to span across both screens, set the second screen to None in the Style drop down box. (Remember - you need to have the Desktop settings window positioned on the second monitor to do this.) Then move the Desktop settings window back to the monitor with the wallpaper displayed and select Spanning screens from the Style drop down box. Now, you will have wallpaper spanning across both screens; but you still have the panel stuck on only one of them. To get your panel to also span both monitors, go back to the main Settings Manager window and choose Panel under the Personal category. In the Panel settings window, click on the box next to Span Monitors. Congratulations, you have successfully set up and configured dual monitors.

The method used is the same as mentioned above. Output Devices - is for main configuration of sound levels across your system. Input Devices - this includes microphones and other line-in devices, such as TV tuner cards with line in. Adjusting the levels and settings are the same method as described above. Configuration - this lists known profiles for your sound card. In most cases there is no need to select anything here unless you intend to disable your sound completely, or have a unique profile setting, such as surround sound, mono, or stereo out. Notes: Being able to toggle on mute and unmute on multiple things can cause issues. And at times the device may be muted upon install. Show caution here as you may mute a certain program and forget about it entirely. If unmuting and adjusting settings for your sound card and related programs do not work at all, there may be a driver issue. Refer below for resources on how to remedy this. You can find help by using the Lite System Report tool and using the directions to upload the generated report to the Forums. Volume Toggles Here, we will show you how to set keyboard shortcuts for Volume + Volume - and Mute Volume. Providing you are not already using the hot keys on a supported multimedia keyboard, the following is an excellent replacement. First step is to right click on the Volume icon in the tray, select Properties and ensure Enable keyboard shortcuts for volume control is ticked. 1. Next click on Menu, Settings, Keyboard and click on the Applications Shortcuts tab. 2. Next click on the Add button and paste in the following: pactl -- set-sink-volume 0 +10% 3. Click Ok and then hold down the Right Alt key and the =/+ near the top of your keyboard. Now Right Alt plus =/+ is set to raise the main volume. 4. To set a toggle to lower the volume by 10% each time, repeat steps 1 -3 above but this time to lower the volume, enter this command: pactl -- set-sink-volume 0 -10% 5. This time hold down the Right Alt key and the -/_ near the top of your keyboard (next to the =/+ button). Now Right Alt plus -/_ is set to lower the main volume. 6. To set a toggle to mute the volume repeat steps 1 -3 above but this time to mute the volume, enter this command: pactl -- set-sink-mute 0 toggle 7. This time hold down the Right Alt key and the M on your keyboard. Now Right Alt plus M is set to mute the main volume. Now all 3 volume toggles have been set, try them out.

Does Your Newer Computer Use UEFI Firmware for Booting? If you have a newer model computer with UEFI firmware, it may allow for two modes of booting: UEFI/EFI-mode or BIOS/CSM/Legacy-mode. There is a good chance that Windows is installed to the hard drive in UEFI-mode. In that case it will also be using the newer GPT partitioning scheme on the hard drive. (This applies mainly to Windows 8, but some versions of Windows 7 may be installed that way too.) You need to confirm for sure which way Windows is installed before attempting the Linux Lite installation. The first thing to check is whether or not you are using a 64-bit version of Windows. You should be able to find that out by going to the \"System\" section from the \"Control Panel\". If you find that it is a 32-bit version, then you will be able to install Linux Lite. (Only 64-bit versions of Windows currently support UEFI booting.) If you have a 64-bit version of Windows, it could be installed in either BIOS/Legacy-mode or in UEFI-mode; so you will need to investigate further. Go to Windows disk management and take a look at the partitions on the hard drive. If you see a small partition near the beginning of the drive, formatted as FAT32, labeled along the lines of \"System\" or \"EFI System Partition\", then you have a UEFI installation of Windows and will not be able to properly install Linux Lite. If you don't see that partition, then you should have an MBR-partitioned disk and you can install Linux Lite. If you need help figuring that out, take a screenshot of your hard drive partitions and post that to the Forums with your inquiry. Dual Boot Install on Systems with More Than One Hard Drive? When choosing to install Linux Lite alongside Windows on a computer with more than one hard drive, the default action of the installer is to install the Linux boot loader to the MBR of the first hard drive. Since Windows is likely installed to the first drive, its boot loader will be replaced on the MBR with the Linux boot loader. The Linux boot loader will see the Windows installation and add it to the boot menu on start-up. This is how most people do the installation. However, some people prefer to keep the Windows boot loader intact on its own drive and install the Linux boot loader to its own drive. (There are various reasons for doing that, the most common being that it makes booting Windows easier if they decide to remove the Linux installation.) After the installation completes, they then set the computer's BIOS to boot from the Linux drive. Even though the Linux boot loader is installed to a separate drive, it will see the Windows installation and add a boot choice for it. By booting from the Linux drive, you get the choice to boot either OS. If you later remove Linux, simply reset the BIOS to boot from the Windows drive and it will boot Windows as it did before your installation of Linux. To accomplish this, you must choose the \"Something else\" option from the \"Installation Type\" screen during installation. On the following screen you will set-up your partitions and mount points manually. Then, near the bottom of the window, you need to set the \"location for boot loader installation\" to the MBR of the drive containing Linux Lite. For example, if you had two hard drives - /dev/sda (Windows) and /dev/sdb (Linux) - you would set the location to /dev/sdb (without any partition number at the end). If you are not experienced with partitioning, or are unsure about how to proceed, post on our Forums for assistance.

Top of page Dual Monitor Setup Instructions If you have two monitors, they will start out 'mirroring' the same displayed output. To get the monitors to act as one large area allowing you to spread your work out separately on each, you can now do that easily through the GUI Settings Manager instead of through terminal commands and manually editing configuration files. Go to Menu, Settings, Settings Manager. Click on Display under the Hardware category. Initially, both monitors will have the Mirror displays box checked. Click on the first monitor listed on the left and un-check Mirror displays on the right. Repeat the procedure for the second monitor. Drag and drop each screen to where you want them to be arranged. Click Apply when you are finished. Once they are no longer mirrored, you may see that one of them is missing the desktop wallpaper and the lower panel only spans one of them. Click All Settings to go back to the main Settings Manager window and choose Desktop under the Personal category. Whichever monitor the Desktop settings window is on, that is the one it will apply to. Drag it over to the monitor that is blank and notice how the monitor description changes according to which one it is on. When you drag the Display settings window over to another monitor, the wallpaper that was highlighted on the one you dragged from stays highlighted, but no change will take effect on the second monitor until you actually click on one of the wallpapers. You may set a different wallpaper for each monitor. If you want one picture to span across both screens, set the second screen to None in the Style drop down box. (Remember - you need to have the Desktop settings window positioned on the second monitor to do this.) Then move the Desktop settings window back to the monitor with the wallpaper displayed and select Spanning screens from the Style drop down box. Now, you will have wallpaper spanning across both screens; but you still have the panel stuck on only one of them. To get your panel to also span both monitors, go back to the main Settings Manager window and choose Panel under the Personal category. In the Panel settings window, click on the box next to Span Monitors. Congratulations, you have successfully set up and configured dual monitors.

Configuration - this lists known profiles for your sound card. In most cases there is no need to select anything here unless you intend to disable your sound completely, or have a unique profile setting, such as surround sound, mono, or stereo out. Notes: Being able to toggle on mute and unmute on multiple things can cause issues. And at times the device may be muted upon install. Show caution here as you may mute a certain program and forget about it entirely. If unmuting and adjusting settings for your sound card and related programs do not work at all, there may be a driver issue. Refer below for resources on how to remedy this. You can find help by using the Lite System Report tool and using the directions to upload the generated report to the Forums. Volume Toggles Here, we will show you how to set keyboard shortcuts for Volume + Volume - and Mute Volume. Providing you are not already using the hot keys on a supported multimedia keyboard, the following is an excellent replacement. First step is to right click on the Volume icon in the tray, select Properties and ensure Enable keyboard shortcuts for volume control is ticked. 1. Next click on Menu, Settings, Keyboard and click on the Applications Shortcuts tab. 2. Next click on the Add button and paste in the following: pactl -- set-sink-volume 0 +10% 3. Click Ok and then hold down the Right Alt key and the =/+ near the top of your keyboard. Now Right Alt plus =/+ is set to raise the main volume. 4. To set a toggle to lower the volume by 10% each time, repeat steps 1 -3 above but this time to lower the volume, enter this command: pactl -- set-sink-volume 0 -10% 5. This time hold down the Right Alt key and the -/_ near the top of your keyboard (next to the =/+ button). Now Right Alt plus -/_ is set to lower the main volume. 6. To set a toggle to mute the volume repeat steps 1 -3 above but this time to mute the volume, enter this command: pactl -- set-sink-mute 0 toggle 7. This time hold down the Right Alt key and the M on your keyboard. Now Right Alt plus M is set to mute the main volume. Now all 3 volume toggles have been set, try them out.

Top of page Printer Setup 1. Plugging in a printer will prompt a dialog if detected and attempt to find a matching driver. (If your driver was plugged in during your initial install you may not see a prompt, you may refer to step 3 below.) 2. If a printer and driver has been detected you will see this dialog. (Note, the dialog should appear in upper right of your screen) 3. You can further configure or manage printing jobs or printers by going to printing located in Menu, System, Printers. 4. Once you open the Printing menu it will bring you to a simple dialog to select, view and manage options related to your printer. 5. You can find options for your printer by highlighting (left clicking) on your printer, then click on Printer, Properties. 6. If a printer if not listed in the window after opening it, you will need to plug in the device and click on the + sign located below the menu. 7. Once you click on the + sign above, you will see this window if the printer was detected properly. You can then select the method of connect and printer on the pane near the bottom of the window. (You may see more than one option if your device is an all in one device, so select from the left pane carefully.) From here you can also select a Network Printer if you are connected to a home network and a printer is available. 7.1 If for some reason you are unable to see a network printer on a machine using Windows you may need to configure samba (a sharing and networking tool for Linux > Windows) You can find help doing this here. 8. Clicking Forward on the above window will bring you to this window where you can set the Printer Name, Description and Location for the printer. However Description and Location are not required, unless you share a printer or use one over a network. 9. Cups is a web interface for managing your printer. Once installed, click here to manage your printer. Top of page Share your Printer from Linux Lite The following tutorial gives an example of how to set up a shared printer connected to Linux Lite. Make sure the printer connected to Linux Lite and is fully operational, drivers installed and set up. Temporarily disable the Linux Lite Firewall, see here. After you are able to print from Windows to a Linux Lite shared printer, we will enable it again and create the correct rule for it. Firewall blocking services is usually overlooked. Click on Menu, System, Printers. Select (highlight) your Printer and select from the menu Printer, Shared. Then, considering this is a home network and that you want to make your life as easy as possible, let's allow quite a few options in Server Settings. Open Server, Settings and configure as shown below: That's all there is on your Linux Lite side. Now let's go to your Windows 10 machine to connect to the shared printer. Before going into Windows, make sure you know the correct name of your printer. For example, my printer name is Samsung-ML-2550 (case sensitive). This is the name you define when adding the printer to Linux Lite. You do not want to have spaces in the name and also understand that lower case and UPPER case do make a difference in Linux. So, with that said, in Windows 10: Devices and Printers -> Add a printer - The printer that I want isn't listed. Select a shared printer by name. The printer can the be added using the hostname or the IP address of your Linux Lite PC on port 631. To keep it simple, in case you do not have DNS resolution in your local network, you will use the IP address of your Linux Lite PC, as shown below: http://[LINUX LITE PC IP]:631/printers/[YOUR PRINTER'S CASE SENSITIVE NAME] From there, just select the brand and model for your printer as you usually do in Windows... and you should be able to print thereafter. Once you can print from Windows, you can re-enable your firewall and use the firewall tutorial section to add CUPS as a Service, and allow port 631 for both TCP and UDP eg.

Click Advanced options to see all the features. Now use Boot Repair to carry out the task you need doing. Boot Repair is in Menu, System, Repair the boot of the computer. More information can be found here - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair Top of page Installation Issues No Option to Install Alongside Windows? If this happens, it usually means that Windows is already using four partitions on the hard drive, which is the limit for BIOS based computers using traditional MBR type partitions. (Newer computers may that use UEFI firmware may use GPT partitioned drives that do not have the 4 partition limit. This discussion does not get into that.) You will need to either eliminate one of the current partitions, or add another hard drive to the computer for installing Linux Lite. If you are unfamiliar with partitioning, it would be best to make a post on the Forums for help before proceeding. Generally speaking, in this situation there is may be a partition set aside where the manufacture has put copies of drivers and other extras that were part of the initial installation. There may also be a recovery partition that gets used for reinstalling Windows in the event that is needed. If you went through the process of creating a recovery USB or set of recovery DVD's, then you can probably get rid of the recovery partition. Same goes for the partition set aside for manufacturer installed drivers and extras, if you made a copy of that. Once one or both of those partitions has been deleted, you may also need to shrink the main (largest) Windows partition (probably labeled as \"C: drive\"). If you have the space, ideally you should try to allocate 50-100GB for Linux Lite. (It will be fine with +/-15GB; but you won't have much room for expansion). Before shrinking any partition, be sure to defragment the partition in Windows first. Then shrink the partition and leave the free space as it is, un-partitioned. Do not create Linux partitions with Windows disk manager. It is best done using Linux tools. At that point, you can go ahead and run the installer again and it should now offer the choice to install \"Alongside Windows\". If it needs to it will create an \"extended\" partition that will serve as a container for the \"logical\" partitions needed for the installation. (That is a way that is commonly used to get around the 4-partition maximum rule. As long as only 3 partitions are \"primary\", an extended partition can be used to house multiple logical partitions within it - thus giving you the ability to have more than four partitions.) Does Your Newer Computer Use UEFI Firmware for Booting? If you have a newer model computer with UEFI firmware, it may allow for two modes of booting: UEFI/EFI-mode or BIOS/CSM/Legacy-mode. There is a good chance that Windows is installed to the hard drive in UEFI-mode. In that case it will also be using the newer GPT partitioning scheme on the hard drive. (This applies mainly to Windows 8, but some versions of Windows 7 may be installed that way too.)

Top of page Graphics - NVIDIA If you're not sure if your graphics card is nVidia or not, open up a terminal and run this command: Terminal Command: sudo lshw -C display You see under product: nVidia or GeForce (and similar naming schemes for nVidia cards) depending on your card. The vendor: line may also show you the Product or Company name. NOTE: You must be connected to the internet before you start the driver install. The next step is to go to Menu, Settings, Install Drivers. The program will then scan your computer for any drivers that you may need, this may take some time. When it has finished scanning, you will see a dialogue box similar to the one below. Generally you will want to select the current version, the tested driver. In the above example we selected the Using NVIDIA binary driver (proprietary, tested). NOTE: If you plan to play graphic intensive games or you have a lot of Steam games, you need to select the proprietary, tested driver. Now click on Apply Changes. You will be prompted for your password: You will see the following dialog as it downloads and installs: When the driver has finished, restart your computer. Now head over to Menu, System, NVIDIA X Server Settings. Once you open NVIDIA X Server Settings, you will have a number of options to select as well as some technical data to look over. Top of page Graphics - NVIDIA Prime This method should ONLY be used if the above nVidia install method does not give you Prime options in the Nvidia Settings Manager. From a fresh install of Linux Lite, open up a terminal and type: Terminal Command: sudo apt-get update To install the recommended driver, run the following command: Terminal Command: sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall Now restart your computer. Top of page Dual Monitor Setup Instructions If you have two monitors, they will start out 'mirroring' the same displayed output. To get the monitors to act as one large area allowing you to spread your work out separately on each, you can now do that easily through the GUI Settings Manager instead of through terminal commands and manually editing configuration files. Go to Menu, Settings, Settings Manager. Click on Display under the Hardware category. Initially, both monitors will have the Mirror displays box checked. Click on the first monitor listed on the left and un-check Mirror displays on the right. Repeat the procedure for the second monitor. Drag and drop each screen to where you want them to be arranged. Click Apply when you are finished. Once they are no longer mirrored, you may see that one of them is missing the desktop wallpaper and the lower panel only spans one of them. Click All Settings to go back to the main Settings Manager window and choose Desktop under the Personal category. Whichever monitor the Desktop settings window is on, that is the one it will apply to. Drag it over to the monitor that is blank and notice how the monitor description changes according to which one it is on. When you drag the Display settings window over to another monitor, the wallpaper that was highlighted on the one you dragged from stays highlighted, but no change will take effect on the second monitor until you actually click on one of the wallpapers. You may set a different wallpaper for each monitor. If you want one picture to span across both screens, set the second screen to None in the Style drop down box. (Remember - you need to have the Desktop settings window positioned on the second monitor to do this.) Then move the Desktop settings window back to the monitor with the wallpaper displayed and select Spanning screens from the Style drop down box. Now, you will have wallpaper spanning across both screens; but you still have the panel stuck on only one of them. To get your panel to also span both monitors, go back to the main Settings Manager window and choose Panel under the Personal category. In the Panel settings window, click on the box next to Span Monitors. Congratulations, you have successfully set up and configured dual monitors.

Top of page Printer Setup 1. Plugging in a printer will prompt a dialog if detected and attempt to find a matching driver. (If your driver was plugged in during your initial install you may not see a prompt, you may refer to step 3 below.) 2. If a printer and driver has been detected you will see this dialog. (Note, the dialog should appear in upper right of your screen) 3. You can further configure or manage printing jobs or printers by going to printing located in Menu, System, Printers. 4. Once you open the Printing menu it will bring you to a simple dialog to select, view and manage options related to your printer. 5. You can find options for your printer by highlighting (left clicking) on your printer, then click on Printer, Properties. 6. If a printer if not listed in the window after opening it, you will need to plug in the device and click on the + sign located below the menu. 7. Once you click on the + sign above, you will see this window if the printer was detected properly. You can then select the method of connect and printer on the pane near the bottom of the window. (You may see more than one option if your device is an all in one device, so select from the left pane carefully.) From here you can also select a Network Printer if you are connected to a home network and a printer is available. 7.1 If for some reason you are unable to see a network printer on a machine using Windows you may need to configure samba (a sharing and networking tool for Linux > Windows) You can find help doing this here. 8. Clicking Forward on the above window will bring you to this window where you can set the Printer Name, Description and Location for the printer. However Description and Location are not required, unless you share a printer or use one over a network. 9. Cups is a web interface for managing your printer. Once installed, click here to manage your printer. Top of page Share your Printer from Linux Lite The following tutorial gives an example of how to set up a shared printer connected to Linux Lite. Make sure the printer connected to Linux Lite and is fully operational, drivers installed and set up. Temporarily disable the Linux Lite Firewall, see here. After you are able to print from Windows to a Linux Lite shared printer, we will enable it again and create the correct rule for it. Firewall blocking services is usually overlooked. Click on Menu, System, Printers. Select (highlight) your Printer and select from the menu Printer, Shared. Then, considering this is a home network and that you want to make your life as easy as possible, let's allow quite a few options in Server Settings. Open Server, Settings and configure as shown below: That's all there is on your Linux Lite side. Now let's go to your Windows 10 machine to connect to the shared printer. Before going into Windows, make sure you know the correct name of your printer. For example, my printer name is Samsung-ML-2550 (case sensitive). This is the name you define when adding the printer to Linux Lite. You do not want to have spaces in the name and also understand that lower case and UPPER case do make a difference in Linux. So, with that said, in Windows 10: Devices and Printers -> Add a printer - The printer that I want isn't listed. Select a shared printer by name. The printer can the be added using the hostname or the IP address of your Linux Lite PC on port 631. To keep it simple, in case you do not have DNS resolution in your local network, you will use the IP address of your Linux Lite PC, as shown below: http://[LINUX LITE PC IP]:631/printers/[YOUR PRINTER'S CASE SENSITIVE NAME] From there, just select the brand and model for your printer as you usually do in Windows... and you should be able to print thereafter. Once you can print from Windows, you can re-enable your firewall and use the firewall tutorial section to add CUPS as a Service, and allow port 631 for both TCP and UDP eg.

Now press either F10 or Ctrl+X to boot your machine. Your computer will begin to boot up with scrolling text similar to what is shown below: After which shortly you will get your normal login screen. Now you can login and install your graphics drivers. Dual Boot Modification/Repair You may be in a situation where you want to modify or repair your dual boot set up. Boot Repair is an excellent tool for the job. To install Boot Repair, open a terminal and type (one line at a time): Terminal Command: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair Terminal Command: sudo apt-get update Terminal Command: sudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &) After the install Boot Repair will launch automatically and scan your computer for your boot configuration and other operating systems. Click Advanced options to see all the features. Now use Boot Repair to carry out the task you need doing. Boot Repair is in Menu, System, Repair the boot of the computer. More information can be found here - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair Top of page Installation Issues No Option to Install Alongside Windows? If this happens, it usually means that Windows is already using four partitions on the hard drive, which is the limit for BIOS based computers using traditional MBR type partitions. (Newer computers may that use UEFI firmware may use GPT partitioned drives that do not have the 4 partition limit. This discussion does not get into that.) You will need to either eliminate one of the current partitions, or add another hard drive to the computer for installing Linux Lite. If you are unfamiliar with partitioning, it would be best to make a post on the Forums for help before proceeding. Generally speaking, in this situation there is may be a partition set aside where the manufacture has put copies of drivers and other extras that were part of the initial installation. There may also be a recovery partition that gets used for reinstalling Windows in the event that is needed. If you went through the process of creating a recovery USB or set of recovery DVD's, then you can probably get rid of the recovery partition. Same goes for the partition set aside for manufacturer installed drivers and extras, if you made a copy of that. Once one or both of those partitions has been deleted, you may also need to shrink the main (largest) Windows partition (probably labeled as \"C: drive\"). If you have the space, ideally you should try to allocate 50-100GB for Linux Lite. (It will be fine with +/-15GB; but you won't have much room for expansion). Before shrinking any partition, be sure to defragment the partition in Windows first. Then shrink the partition and leave the free space as it is, un-partitioned. Do not create Linux partitions with Windows disk manager. It is best done using Linux tools. At that point, you can go ahead and run the installer again and it should now offer the choice to install \"Alongside Windows\". If it needs to it will create an \"extended\" partition that will serve as a container for the \"logical\" partitions needed for the installation. (That is a way that is commonly used to get around the 4-partition maximum rule. As long as only 3 partitions are \"primary\", an extended partition can be used to house multiple logical partitions within it - thus giving you the ability to have more than four partitions.) Does Your Newer Computer Use UEFI Firmware for Booting? If you have a newer model computer with UEFI firmware, it may allow for two modes of booting: UEFI/EFI-mode or BIOS/CSM/Legacy-mode. There is a good chance that Windows is installed to the hard drive in UEFI-mode. In that case it will also be using the newer GPT partitioning scheme on the hard drive. (This applies mainly to Windows 8, but some versions of Windows 7 may be installed that way too.) You need to confirm for sure which way Windows is installed before attempting the Linux Lite installation. The first thing to check is whether or not you are using a 64-bit version of Windows. You should be able to find that out by going to the \"System\" section from the \"Control Panel\". If you find that it is a 32-bit version, then you will be able to install Linux Lite. (Only 64-bit versions of Windows currently support UEFI booting.) If you have a 64-bit version of Windows, it could be installed in either BIOS/Legacy-mode or in UEFI-mode; so you will need to investigate further. Go to Windows disk management and take a look at the partitions on the hard drive. If you see a small partition near the beginning of the drive, formatted as FAT32, labeled along the lines of \"System\" or \"EFI System Partition\", then you have a UEFI installation of Windows and will not be able to properly install Linux Lite. If you don't see that partition, then you should have an MBR-partitioned disk and you can install Linux Lite. If you need help figuring that out, take a screenshot of your hard drive partitions and post that to the Forums with your inquiry. Dual Boot Install on Systems with More Than One Hard Drive? When choosing to install Linux Lite alongside Windows on a computer with more than one hard drive, the default action of the installer is to install the Linux boot loader to the MBR of the first hard drive. Since Windows is likely installed to the first drive, its boot loader will be replaced on the MBR with the Linux boot loader. The Linux boot loader will see the Windows installation and add it to the boot menu on start-up. This is how most people do the installation. However, some people prefer to keep the Windows boot loader intact on its own drive and install the Linux boot loader to its own drive. (There are various reasons for doing that, the most common being that it makes booting Windows easier if they decide to remove the Linux installation.) After the installation completes, they then set the computer's BIOS to boot from the Linux drive. Even though the Linux boot loader is installed to a separate drive, it will see the Windows installation and add a boot choice for it. By booting from the Linux drive, you get the choice to boot either OS. If you later remove Linux, simply reset the BIOS to boot from the Windows drive and it will boot Windows as it did before your installation of Linux. To accomplish this, you must choose the \"Something else\" option from the \"Installation Type\" screen during installation. On the following screen you will set-up your partitions and mount points manually. Then, near the bottom of the window, you need to set the \"location for boot loader installation\" to the MBR of the drive containing Linux Lite. For example, if you had two hard drives - /dev/sda (Windows) and /dev/sdb (Linux) - you would set the location to /dev/sdb (without any partition number at the end). If you are not experienced with partitioning, or are unsure about how to proceed, post on our Forums for assistance. Top of page Lite System Report tool The Lite System Report tool was created to better help people who experienced a problem with their computer.

Top of page Printer Setup 1. Plugging in a printer will prompt a dialog if detected and attempt to find a matching driver. (If your driver was plugged in during your initial install you may not see a prompt, you may refer to step 3 below.) 2. If a printer and driver has been detected you will see this dialog. (Note, the dialog should appear in upper right of your screen) 3. You can further configure or manage printing jobs or printers by going to printing located in Menu, System, Printers. 4. Once you open the Printing menu it will bring you to a simple dialog to select, view and manage options related to your printer. 5. You can find options for your printer by highlighting (left clicking) on your printer, then click on Printer, Properties. 6. If a printer if not listed in the window after opening it, you will need to plug in the device and click on the + sign located below the menu. 7. Once you click on the + sign above, you will see this window if the printer was detected properly. You can then select the method of connect and printer on the pane near the bottom of the window. (You may see more than one option if your device is an all in one device, so select from the left pane carefully.) From here you can also select a Network Printer if you are connected to a home network and a printer is available. 7.1 If for some reason you are unable to see a network printer on a machine using Windows you may need to configure samba (a sharing and networking tool for Linux > Windows) You can find help doing this here. 8. Clicking Forward on the above window will bring you to this window where you can set the Printer Name, Description and Location for the printer. However Description and Location are not required, unless you share a printer or use one over a network. 9. Cups is a web interface for managing your printer. Once installed, click here to manage your printer. Top of page Share your Printer from Linux Lite The following tutorial gives an example of how to set up a shared printer connected to Linux Lite. Make sure the printer connected to Linux Lite and is fully operational, drivers installed and set up. Temporarily disable the Linux Lite Firewall, see here. After you are able to print from Windows to a Linux Lite shared printer, we will enable it again and create the correct rule for it. Firewall blocking services is usually overlooked. Click on Menu, System, Printers. Select (highlight) your Printer and select from the menu Printer, Shared. Then, considering this is a home network and that you want to make your life as easy as possible, let's allow quite a few options in Server Settings. Open Server, Settings and configure as shown below: That's all there is on your Linux Lite side. Now let's go to your Windows 10 machine to connect to the shared printer. Before going into Windows, make sure you know the correct name of your printer. For example, my printer name is Samsung-ML-2550 (case sensitive). This is the name you define when adding the printer to Linux Lite. You do not want to have spaces in the name and also understand that lower case and UPPER case do make a difference in Linux. So, with that said, in Windows 10: Devices and Printers -> Add a printer - The printer that I want isn't listed. Select a shared printer by name. The printer can the be added using the hostname or the IP address of your Linux Lite PC on port 631. To keep it simple, in case you do not have DNS resolution in your local network, you will use the IP address of your Linux Lite PC, as shown below: http://[LINUX LITE PC IP]:631/printers/[YOUR PRINTER'S CASE SENSITIVE NAME] From there, just select the brand and model for your printer as you usually do in Windows... and you should be able to print thereafter. Once you can print from Windows, you can re-enable your firewall and use the firewall tutorial section to add CUPS as a Service, and allow port 631 for both TCP and UDP eg.

More information can be found here - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair Top of page Installation Issues No Option to Install Alongside Windows? If this happens, it usually means that Windows is already using four partitions on the hard drive, which is the limit for BIOS based computers using traditional MBR type partitions. (Newer computers may that use UEFI firmware may use GPT partitioned drives that do not have the 4 partition limit. This discussion does not get into that.) You will need to either eliminate one of the current partitions, or add another hard drive to the computer for installing Linux Lite. If you are unfamiliar with partitioning, it would be best to make a post on the Forums for help before proceeding. Generally speaking, in this situation there is may be a partition set aside where the manufacture has put copies of drivers and other extras that were part of the initial installation. There may also be a recovery partition that gets used for reinstalling Windows in the event that is needed. If you went through the process of creating a recovery USB or set of recovery DVD's, then you can probably get rid of the recovery partition. Same goes for the partition set aside for manufacturer installed drivers and extras, if you made a copy of that. Once one or both of those partitions has been deleted, you may also need to shrink the main (largest) Windows partition (probably labeled as \"C: drive\"). If you have the space, ideally you should try to allocate 50-100GB for Linux Lite. (It will be fine with +/-15GB; but you won't have much room for expansion). Before shrinking any partition, be sure to defragment the partition in Windows first. Then shrink the partition and leave the free space as it is, un-partitioned. Do not create Linux partitions with Windows disk manager. It is best done using Linux tools. At that point, you can go ahead and run the installer again and it should now offer the choice to install \"Alongside Windows\". If it needs to it will create an \"extended\" partition that will serve as a container for the \"logical\" partitions needed for the installation. (That is a way that is commonly used to get around the 4-partition maximum rule. As long as only 3 partitions are \"primary\", an extended partition can be used to house multiple logical partitions within it - thus giving you the ability to have more than four partitions.) Does Your Newer Computer Use UEFI Firmware for Booting? If you have a newer model computer with UEFI firmware, it may allow for two modes of booting: UEFI/EFI-mode or BIOS/CSM/Legacy-mode. There is a good chance that Windows is installed to the hard drive in UEFI-mode. In that case it will also be using the newer GPT partitioning scheme on the hard drive. (This applies mainly to Windows 8, but some versions of Windows 7 may be installed that way too.) You need to confirm for sure which way Windows is installed before attempting the Linux Lite installation. The first thing to check is whether or not you are using a 64-bit version of Windows. You should be able to find that out by going to the \"System\" section from the \"Control Panel\". If you find that it is a 32-bit version, then you will be able to install Linux Lite. (Only 64-bit versions of Windows currently support UEFI booting.) If you have a 64-bit version of Windows, it could be installed in either BIOS/Legacy-mode or in UEFI-mode; so you will need to investigate further. Go to Windows disk management and take a look at the partitions on the hard drive. If you see a small partition near the beginning of the drive, formatted as FAT32, labeled along the lines of \"System\" or \"EFI System Partition\", then you have a UEFI installation of Windows and will not be able to properly install Linux Lite. If you don't see that partition, then you should have an MBR-partitioned disk and you can install Linux Lite. If you need help figuring that out, take a screenshot of your hard drive partitions and post that to the Forums with your inquiry. Dual Boot Install on Systems with More Than One Hard Drive? When choosing to install Linux Lite alongside Windows on a computer with more than one hard drive, the default action of the installer is to install the Linux boot loader to the MBR of the first hard drive. Since Windows is likely installed to the first drive, its boot loader will be replaced on the MBR with the Linux boot loader. The Linux boot loader will see the Windows installation and add it to the boot menu on start-up. This is how most people do the installation. However, some people prefer to keep the Windows boot loader intact on its own drive and install the Linux boot loader to its own drive. (There are various reasons for doing that, the most common being that it makes booting Windows easier if they decide to remove the Linux installation.) After the installation completes, they then set the computer's BIOS to boot from the Linux drive. Even though the Linux boot loader is installed to a separate drive, it will see the Windows installation and add a boot choice for it. By booting from the Linux drive, you get the choice to boot either OS. If you later remove Linux, simply reset the BIOS to boot from the Windows drive and it will boot Windows as it did before your installation of Linux. To accomplish this, you must choose the \"Something else\" option from the \"Installation Type\" screen during installation. On the following screen you will set-up your partitions and mount points manually. Then, near the bottom of the window, you need to set the \"location for boot loader installation\" to the MBR of the drive containing Linux Lite. For example, if you had two hard drives - /dev/sda (Windows) and /dev/sdb (Linux) - you would set the location to /dev/sdb (without any partition number at the end). If you are not experienced with partitioning, or are unsure about how to proceed, post on our Forums for assistance. Top of page Lite System Report tool The Lite System Report tool was created to better help people who experienced a problem with their computer. The report contains useful information about the hardware, network and software. The idea of the tool is to run it, then you would attach the generated file to a Forum thread with a title about the issue you are having. Lets get started. Click on Menu, Settings, Lite System Report. A window will pop open, read the information and click on Continue when ready. Enter your password and press the Enter key. Unselect the options you don't need to or have been asked to exclude from your Report. The report will take anywhere from a few seconds to less than a minute depending on your hardware. When it is finished, the Report will appear. The Report will be similar to the one below. Click on Save. Next you'll be asked where to save the Report, in the following example we select our Home folder (/home/jerry). In this example the Report is located in /home/jerry. Go to the Linux Lite Forums.

To create a bootable DVD, you need to burn the ISO as an \"image\" to the DVD. Below are listed three free Windows programs that will enable you to do that. If burning to a USB stick, we have also listed a free program that we recommend for doing that in Windows; or a reliable method to create a bootable USB when using a Linux system, or OSX. Once you have your bootable media created, you may need to access your computer's BIOS settings to set the boot order for booting CD/DVD/USB's first (before the hard drive). Typically there will be one or two special keys that can be pressed during initial power-up of the computer (before an operating system starts booting) that will allow you access to either the BIOS Settings/Startup Menu or a separate Boot Menu. Specific keys vary from one manufacturer to the next, so refer to your user manual if you are not sure how to access the settings. Writing the Linux Lite ISO to a USB on Windows A good, simple point and click USB ISO burner is Etcher or Rufus. Links - Etcher Home Page, Rufus Home Page. Guide: - Insert a 4Gb or larger USB stick into your PC. You MUST format the entire USB drive to Fat32 before proceeding. - Install, then start Etcher or Rufus. - Select the Linux Lite ISO file from Etcher or Rufus and write the image to your USB. These instructions are generic for Windows (Rufus is Windows only), Linux and Mac OS. Writing the Linux Lite ISO to a DVD on Windows Here is some free DVD burning software for you to select from: BurnAware Free - http://www.burnaware.com CDBurnerXP - http://cdburnerxp.se/ ImgBurn - http://www.imgburn.com/ Place a blank DVD in your DVD drive, open up the program, select the ISO file that you want to burn. Choose the lowest burn speed, this will greatly reduce the risk of your burn becoming corrupt as can sometimes happen. A 4x or 6x speed is recommended if you have it. The lower the burn speed, the better. Writing the Linux Lite ISO to USB on Linux (see above, the process is similar) Etcher allows you to create a bootable Live USB drive. You will need a 4Gb or larger USB drive. Download Etcher from here. Writing the Linux Lite ISO to USB in Linux and OSX (see above, the process is similar) Using a GUI application You can use Etcher as mentioned above to write the Linux Lite ISO image to a USB. You will need a 4Gb or larger USB drive. Etcher works on - Windows, Mac & Linux. Download it from here. Using a Terminal To find out the letter of your USB stick, open a terminal and type: df -h It is usually listed as /media/yourusername/ or similar. Be very careful to make sure you choose the right drive letter, as you can see in the Filesystem column, my device is /dev/sda1 another clue is the value in the Size column, here it is shown as 7.6G. In this example my device is listed as: /media/jerry/STUFF in the Mounted on column. Open a folder and make sure you are in the directory that the iso file is in. Open a terminal in that directory and type the following: Terminal Command: sudo dd if=linux-lite-6.6-64bit.iso of=/dev/sdx bs=4M Change the x in sdx to match the letter of your USB device. In the above example, my device is shown as sda1 (leave out the '1') Example Terminal Command: sudo dd if=linux-lite-6.6-64bit.iso of=/dev/sda bs=4M The Live DVD/USB image will boot into the desktop automatically, there is no need to login manually. No USB Boot option in the BIOS? Use PloP For full instructions click here. Preparing your Computer for the Installation If you are planning to have Linux Lite as the sole operating system on your computer, there is nothing special you need to do in preparation for the installation, even if another operating system is currently occupying the hard drive. Simply boot up your live installation disk, give Linux Lite a test run if you'd like, then start the installation by double-clicking the Install Linux Lite icon on the desktop. When you get to the Installation Type screen, tell the installer to use the whole disk and it will go ahead and erase anything that is already there, create the partitions needed, format them and install the system automatically. If you currently have one physical hard drive and want to dual-boot Windows and Linux Lite, then you should do a few things to prepare for the installation to insure the best results. Create backup copies of any important data files. (You probably won't need them - but if you do, you'll be glad you made the backups.) Create Windows recovery disk(s) if you haven't already done so before. Defragment your largest Windows partition (likely the \"C: drive\"). If Windows partitions currently span the entire hard drive, one (or more) of its partitions will need to be shrunk down to make room for the Linux installation. Shrink the Windows partition from within Windows disk management. (You can shrink the partition during the installation, but it is probably best to use Windows to shrink Windows partitions.) If you defragmented and shrunk the Windows partition ahead of time, leave the resulting space as unpartitioned, unused, free space. DO NOT create any new partitions from within Windows for the Linux Lite installation. (If you are familiar with partitioning and want to create the partitions ahead of time, use GParted for doing that while booted in the live Linux Lite DVD/USB.) If you plan to have the shrinking done by the installer, it is still recommended that you defragment the Windows partition ahead of time. If you have more than one physical hard drive and want to dual-boot Windows and Linux Lite, with Linux Lite on its own dedicated physical drive, then we recommend you make a request for guidance in our Forum if you are unfamiliar with Linux based installations. Otherwise, general instructions for such an installation are listed below. Choose \"Something else\" on the \"Installation Type\" screen during installation. (See instructions in following section for pictures of installation stages.) On the following page, choose the specific drive that you want for Linux Lite. Create your partitions, choose appropriate file system types, and designate mount points. Near bottom of the window, select a drive for the boot loader installation. (That will be something like /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, etc. - without a partition # after it. Not /dev/sda1, for instance.) It will be pre-filled for the MBR of the first hard drive. If Windows is on the first drive, it's boot loader will be replaced with the Linux boot loader (grub2) unless you specify a different drive. That is fine, but an alternative is to install the boot loader to the Linux hard drive, then set the BIOS to boot from that drive. That will preserve the Windows boot loader on its own drive. Once installation is complete, reboot and the Linux boot loader will have automatically detected your Windows installation and added it to the boot menu choices. Top of page Installing Linux Lite to your computer - UEFI Mode Start your computer, and go into your system BIOS and check that the boot order is set so that DVD and USB devices are set to boot first. This varies from BIOS to BIOS. Refer to your motherboard documentation for more information. You are advised to disable Secure Boot and make sure UEFI is set to Enabled in your BIOS. See here for more information before proceeding if you need any more clarification. Once you are happy with your BIOS set up, insert the DVD disc or USB stick into your computer and reboot your computer. You'll be greeted with the following screen. Let the timer run down if you want to boot to the Live session. Make sure Boot Linux Lite 6.6 Live System is highlighted, press the enter key to boot the Live session. This is also a good way to check that all of your hardware is supported. The other options are: Boot Linux Lite 6.6 Live System - boot directly into the Linux Lite Desktop. Direct install Linux Lite 6.6 - install Linux Lite immediately without booting to the Desktop. Compatibility Mode Linux Lite 6.6 - use this option if you're having trouble with the first 2 options. Check for file system corruption - checks the install image for errors, if none are found, it will boot into the Desktop as per usual. Reboot - restart off your computer. Shutdown - turn off your computer. Some of these boot options may or may not appear as they do in the image above. The types of options varies from release to release. NOTE: If you are having any trouble booting Linux Lite after installation, please read through this trouble shooting guide. The computer will go through the boot up process, this may take anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes depending on your hardware. There will also be a compulsory file check, this is checking all of the files on the DVD or USB to ensure they meet file integrity. It is advised not to skip this procedure. The login for the Live user is automatic, there is no need to login. If for some reason you need to login, simply type in linux beneath Other and click on Log In (no password required). Before we proceed, make sure you have an internet connection first. Click here if you need help to get online before you install Linux Lite. Once you've had a look around Linux Lite and are ready to install the first step is to double click on the Install Linux Lite icon on your Desktop. The installer will then open on the desktop and display the first window of the installer. From here you will select your preferred language and view release notes (option not always available) for this version of Linux Lite. Keyboard layout The next step is to select your keyboard language and layout. You may select the language that your keyboard corresponds to on the left and any specialized layout on the right. This is the point where you may select to enable international keys on your keyboard. Though, these options may be changed later. For a faster install, we recommend you leave the default English (US) options here, and adjust your language settings once Linux Lite has been installed and you have rebooted for the first time. Updates and other software After selecting continue, you are presented with some requirements for the installation. Ensure that these requirements are met by viewing a check mark beside them. You may also choose to download any available updates while installing or install third-party software during the installation. NOTE: 'Download updates while installing Linux' Generally we don't recommend ticking it as this will significantly slow down the install process. Updating after a fresh install is recommended and will save you time in the long run. A typical install on today's hardware will take around 10-15 minutes. If you check these 2 boxes, the install could take over an hour or longer. NOTE: 'Install third-party software for graphics and Wi-Fi hardware and additional media formats' Please verify the legal status of the use of the third party software in your country/territory before choosing this option. This option will install codecs for playing media files, and proprietary drivers for some of your hardware. It is a legal requirement for us to inform you of this. Installation type Now it is time to choose the method of installing Linux Lite to your hard disk. You will have several options during this phase of the installer. Erase Disk and Install Linux NOTE: This option will erase your entire hard drive. Make sure this is what you want to do before proceeding. Upon selecting Erase Disk, the installer will automatically select the default partitioning scheme. Click on Install Now to accept the changes. NOTE: This installation option will automatically install the Linux bootloader to the first hard drive on the system. That is typically how most people install and the Linux boot loader offers the choice of booting any other operating systems that are on your computer. However, if your intent is to keep the Windows boot loader in charge of booting the Windows drive and the Windows drive is the first one, then you need to use the 'Something else' installation type. That way you can control the 'Device for boot loader installation' and set it for the specific drive you choose for Linux Lite. Advanced features There are 2 options in here. Use LVM with the new Linux installation and EXPERIMENTAL: Erase disk and use ZFS. ZFS is an advanced filesystem usually found in Servers. Unless you are familiar with ZFS, there is absolutely no need to use it, doing so could corrupt your system if you don't know what you are doing. NOTE: If you choose the Use LVM with the new Linux installation you will be prompted to enter a strong password. This will option will encrypt your entire Linux Lite install. Encrypting is optional and only recommended for people who understand the encryption process. Selecting Erase disk and install Linux will automatically partition your hard drive as shown below. Something else (dual booting or custom partitioning) Select Something else from this screen if you wish to dual boot with Windows or edit existing partitions (or both). Keeping Windows (dual booting) When manual partitioning, set 500mb of space on sda1 as a EFI System Partition (No Windows operating system installed). If you are dual-booting, create a separate partition, do not use sda1. In this example, we have 3 partitions. sda1 - The recovery partition for Windows. sda2 - Where Windows is installed (note ntfs is the Type). sda3 - The spare, unformatted partition. This is where we will install Linux Lite to. Click on the sda3 partition and click the Change button. Select Ext4 journaling file system, place a tick in Format the partition and select / as the Mount point. Click OK. NOTE: If you have any other NTFS drives, it is important to give these a mount point during the install. That way they will be easily accessible after the installation. The mount point is simply \"where\" in the file system you want that partition's files to show up. You can name the mount point what ever you want, be sure to give it a simple, no spaces lowercase name like eg. /myntfs do not use /My NTFS. DO NOT select 'Format the partition' when editing any NTFS partitions. NOTE: If you are manual partitioning here, make sure in the 'Device for boot loader installation:' drop down, you select /dev/sda. Grub must be installed here to the root sda device or you will have trouble booting. This is the case for ALL partitioning options. When you have finished, click on Install Now. Overwriting Windows In this example, we select the sda2 partition (where Windows is installed) and click the Change button. Select Ext4 journaling file system, place a tick in Format the partition and select / as the Mount point. Click OK. NOTE: Device for boot loader installation. The Linux boot loader offers the choice of booting any other operating systems that are on your computer. In this example since we are over writing Windows, we simply select sda for the boot loader. Whichever method you choose, once you are finished, click on Install Now. Where are you? After completing the partitioning phase of the installation, you are prompted to set up some personal details about the system. The installer will continue to work in the background while you are filling out this information. The first step is to select your time zone. The installer may detect your time zone based on your location via your ISP's information. If not, you may select your time zone by either clicking on your region on the supplied map or by typing in your area in the box below. Who are you? On the next screen, you are greeted by several fields to fill. These fields include: Your name - your real, full name. Your computer's name - the name that you wish to use to identify the computer on your network. Pick a username - your user name that is used to login to the system. Choose a password - your password that you wish to use for your user and sudo (administrator) password. Confirm your password - enter the above password again. NOTE: Choose a strong password, a mix of upper and lower case as well as a mix of numbers and characters. An example of this would be: y%9L2x#o would be considered a strong password. Use a program like KeePassXC to keep all your passwords safely stored and NEVER use the same password for different websites. (KeePassXC is available for installation from Menu, Settings, Lite Software. You do not need to download it from their website.) NEVER COMPROMISE YOUR SECURITY FOR CONVENIENCE. There are also options to enable auto-login for your user or have the computer prompt you for a password everytime you login. If you have a webcam, you may encounter a screen during the install asking to Take a photo this feature is supported so that when you first log in, your photo will be displayed as your avatar. If you skip this step, you can use a .png photo of yourself, rename it to .face and place it in your /home/user folder. By default, the Linux Lite logo will represent your login icon. After finishing all of these steps you will be greeted with a slideshow detailing all of the features and software that are included in this version of Linux Lite. You may allow them to play on their own or navigate through them using the arrow buttons on the sides of the window (the picture below may vary from version to version). Once the installation is complete you will be prompted to either restart your computer and begin using your newly installed Linux Lite system or to continue using the testing environment on the DVD/USB that you are using. If for some reason your computer hangs on restart, press F4 or Enter. After a reboot you will be greeted by the login screen: After you have logged in you will see the desktop and Welcome window. Be sure to read through the Welcome window to get you off to the best possible start to using Linux Lite. Install Updates - do this first (reboot if prompted to after updates have finished). Install Drivers - see if there are any drivers needed for your computer. Set a Restore Point - set your first restore point using Timeshift, similar to System Restore in Windows. Install Language Support - if you are using anything other than English. Select Dark or Light Theme - self explanatory. Installing Linux Lite to your computer - Legacy BIOS Mode Once you are happy with your BIOS set up, insert the DVD disc or USB stick into your computer and reboot your computer. You'll be greeted with the following screen. Let the timer run down if you want to boot to the Live session. Make sure Boot Linux Lite 6.6 Live System is highlighted, press the enter key to boot the Live session. This is also a good way to check that all of your hardware is supported. If you are having trouble booting and you get just a black screen, try the second option, Compatibility Mode Linux Lite 6.6. The other options are: Boot Linux Lite 6.6 Live System - boot directly into the Linux Lite Desktop. Direct install Linux Lite 6.6 - install Linux Lite immediately without booting to the Desktop. Compatibility Mode Linux Lite 6.6 - use this option if you're having trouble with the first 2 options. Check for file system corruption - checks the install image for errors, if none are found, it will boot into the Desktop as per usual. Reboot - restart off your computer. Shutdown - turn off your computer. Some of these boot options may or may not appear as they do in the image above. The number of options changes from release to release. NOTE: If you are having any trouble booting Linux Lite after installation, please read through this trouble shooting guide. The computer will go through the boot up process, this may take anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes depending on your hardware. There will also be a compulsory file check, this is checking all of the files on the DVD or USB to ensure they meet file integrity. It is advised not to skip this procedure. The login for the Live user is automatic, there is no need to login. If for some reason you need to login, simply type in linux beneath Other and click on Log In (no password required). Before we proceed, make sure you have an internet connection first. Click here if you need help to get online before you install Linux Lite. Once you've had a look around Linux Lite and are ready to install the first step is to double click on the Install Linux Lite icon on your Desktop. The installer will then open on the desktop and display the first window of the installer. From here you will select your preferred language and view release notes for this version of Linux Lite. Keyboard layout The next step is to select your keyboard language and layout. You may select the language that your keyboard corresponds to on the left and any specialized layout on the right. This is the point where you may select to enable international keys on your keyboard. Though, these options may be changed later. For a faster install, we recommend you leave the default English (US) options here, and adjust your language settings once Linux Lite has been installed and you have rebooted for the first time. Updates and other software After selecting continue, you are presented with some requirements for the installation. Ensure that these requirements are met by viewing a check mark beside them. You may also choose to download any available updates while installing or install third-party software during the installation. NOTE: 'Download updates while installing Linux' Generally we don't recommend ticking it as this will significantly slow down the install process. Updating after a fresh install is recommended and will save you time in the long run. A typical install on today's hardware will take around 10-15 minutes. If you check these 2 boxes, the install could take over an hour or longer. NOTE: 'Install third-party software for graphics and Wi-Fi hardware and additional media formats' Please verify the legal status of the use of the third party software in your country/territory before choosing this option. This option will install codecs for playing media files, and proprietary drivers for some of your hardware. It is a legal requirement for us to inform you of this. Installation type Now it is time to choose the method of installing Linux Lite to your hard disk. You will have several options during this phase of the installer. Erase Disk and Install Linux NOTE: This option will erase your entire hard drive. Make sure this is what you want to do before proceeding. Upon selecting Erase Disk, the installer will automatically select the default partitioning scheme. Click on Install Now to accept the changes. NOTE: This installation option will automatically install the Linux bootloader to the first hard drive on the system. That is typically how most people install and the Linux boot loader offers the choice of booting any other operating systems that are on your computer. However, if your intent is to keep the Windows boot loader in charge of booting the Windows drive and the Windows drive is the first one, then you need to use the 'Something else' installation type. That way you can control the 'Device for boot loader installation' and set it for the specific drive you choose for Linux Lite. Advanced features There are 2 options in here. Use LVM with the new Linux installation and EXPERIMENTAL: Erase disk and use ZFS. ZFS is an advanced filesystem usually found in Servers. Unless you are familiar with ZFS, there is absolutely no need to use it, doing so could corrupt your system if you don't know what you are doing. NOTE: If you choose the Use LVM with the new Linux installation you will be prompted to enter a strong password. This will option will encrypt your entire Linux Lite install. Encrypting is optional and only recommended for people who understand the encryption process. Something else (dual booting or custom partitioning) Select Something else from this screen if you wish to dual boot with Windows or edit existing partitions (or both). Keeping Windows (dual booting) In this example, we have 3 partitions. sda1 - The recovery partition for Windows. sda2 - Where Windows is installed (note ntfs is the Type). sda3 - The spare, unformatted partition. This is where we will install Linux Lite to. NOTE: If you have any other NTFS drives, it is important to give these a mount point during the install. That way they will be easily accessible after the installation. The mount point is simply \"where\" in the file system you want that partition's files to show up. You can name the mount point what ever you want, be sure to give it a simple, no spaces lowercase name like eg. /myntfs do not use /My NTFS. DO NOT select 'Format the partition' when editing any NTFS partitions. Click on the sda3 partition and click the Change button. Select Ext4 journaling file system, place a tick in Format the partition and select / as the Mount point. Click OK. When you have finished, click on Install Now. Overwriting Windows In this example, we select the sda2 partition (where Windows is installed) and click the Change button. Select Ext4 journaling file system, place a tick in Format the partition and select / as the Mount point. Click OK. NOTE: Device for boot loader installation. The Linux boot loader offers the choice of booting any other operating systems that are on your computer. In this example since we are over writing Windows, we simply select sda for the boot loader. Whichever method you choose, once you are finished, click on Install Now. Where are you? After completing the partitioning phase of the installation, you are prompted to set up some personal details about the system. The installer will continue to work in the background while you are filling out this information. The first step is to select your time zone. The installer may detect your time zone based on your location via your ISP's information. If not, you may select your time zone by either clicking on your region on the supplied map or by typing in your area in the box below. Who are you? On the next screen, you are greeted by several fields to fill. These fields include: Your name - your real, full name. Your computer's name - the name that you wish to use to identify the computer on your network. Pick a username - your user name that is used to login to the system. Choose a password - your password that you wish to use for your user and sudo (administrator) password. Confirm your password - enter the above password again. NOTE: Choose a strong password, a mix of upper and lower case as well as a mix of numbers and characters. An example of this would be: y%9L2x#o would be considered a strong password. Use a program like KeePassXC to keep all your passwords safely stored and NEVER use the same password for different websites. (KeePassXC is available for installation from Menu, Settings, Lite Software. You do not need to download it from their website.) NEVER COMPROMISE YOUR SECURITY FOR CONVENIENCE. There are also options to enable auto-login for your user or have the computer prompt you for a password everytime you login. If you have a webcam, you may encounter a screen during the install asking to Take a photo this feature is supported so that when you first log in, your photo will be displayed as your avatar. If you skip this step, you can use a .png photo of yourself, rename it to .face and place it in your /home/user folder. By default, the Linux Lite logo will represent your login icon. After finishing all of these steps you will be greeted with a slideshow detailing all of the features and software that are included in this version of Linux Lite. You may allow them to play on their own or navigate through them using the arrow buttons on the sides of the window (the picture below may vary from version to version). Once the installation is complete you will be prompted to either restart your computer and begin using your newly installed Linux Lite system or to continue using the testing environment on the DVD/USB that you are using. If for some reason your computer hangs on restart, press F4 or Enter. NOTE: There will be no prompt to remove your DVD or USB after installation so remember to remove your DVD or USB as soon as your pc reboots. After a reboot you will be greeted by the login screen: After you have logged in you will see the desktop and Welcome window. Be sure to read through the Welcome window to get you off to the best possible start to using Linux Lite. Install Updates - do this first (reboot if prompted to after updates have finished). Install Drivers - see if there are any drivers needed for your computer. Set a Restore Point - set your first restore point using Timeshift, similar to System Restore in Windows. Install Language Support - if you are using anything other than English. Select Dark or Light Theme - self explanatory. OEM Install (not in Series 6x) NOTE: You MUST use an Ethernet connection for this process, do not use WiFi. NOTE: These instructions have been left here as a reference for previous Series of Linux Lite where the OEM install option is still available. Some of the wording and screenshots information may differ. Choose - OEM install Linux Lite 6.6 (for manufacturers) from the Boot menu. Wait for the filesystem check to complete. Boot menu: Select your Language, then in the box enter in your computer distribution/company name. Here we will use ACME as our company name. On the next screen, choose your keyboard. Check Download updates while installing Linux. Check Erase disk and install Linux, then click in Install Now. Select your Region. You only need to enter a password on this next box. This password is temporary and is used by the OEM later on. The install will now complete. Eject the install media, and reboot. As the OEM, click on Menu, Accessories, Prepare for Shipping or use the shortcut on the Desktop as shown below. Enter the password you created during the previous install process. The following box will pop up when the process has finished. Click OK, shutdown the machine and prepare your computer for shipping/delivery. Customer Turn on your computer and wait for it to start up. Once it has started, select your language. Click on Continue. Select your Keyboard layout. Select your Region. Enter your details, including a good, strong password. The system will now complete the installation process. If you see some Ubuntu branded slides, just ignore them. Linux Lite is based off Ubuntu and from time to time there may be some mixed branding. You can now log into your computer and start using it. Top of page Securely Erasing files Permanently The following tutorial explains how to set up and securely erase files on Linux Lite. This method will ensure that even with data recovery software, files will be irretrievable. 1. Open your home folder, go to: Edit, Configure custom actions... 2. Click the + symbol in the top right, and enter the following details as shown in the picture below on the Basic tab: Name: Shred file... Description: Securely erase files permanently Command: shred -u %F (the icon chosen here is emblem-important from All Icons) 3. In the Appearance Conditions tab, select the following: File Pattern: * Click on Ok and Close when finished. Now when you want to permanently and securely erase a file from your computer without the chance of recovery, right click any number of files and select Shred file... Top of page Setting your Language Here's how to set a language system wide following an install of Linux Lite. 1. Click on Menu, Settings, Language Support. 2. You will get a dialog box pop up, click on Remind Me Later. 3. Now click on the button Install / Remove Languages. 4. In this example, we'll install the Portuguese language. Scroll down, find your language and tick the box next to it, then click on Apply. You'll then be prompted for your password. After you've entered your password, your computer will begin to download all the language files, this may take a while. 6. Once that is done, scroll to the bottom of the Language for menus and windows box and drag your newly installed language to the top of the list. Then click on Apply System-Wide, you'll be prompted for your password again. Now wait for the settings to be applied, it will take a few moments. 7. Now click on the Regional Formats tab, select the language you just installed, and click on Apply System-Wide. Enter your password again if prompted to. 8. Now logout and login again and you will see that your new language has been applied. Please note that not all programs may not have your language applied. If this is the case, search for that program in Package Manager and see if there is a language pack available for it. Also note that after you have changed your language, some of the Menu items may not be translated properly. There is little we can do about this, an easy way to rename Menu entries is by going to Menu, Settings, Menu Editor and editing the entries there. Top of page Enabling TRIM on your SSD Trim in Linux Lite Series 5.x and onwards is now a SystemD service that runs automatically weekly. There is no need to set up Trim anymore in Linux Lite. You can get further information regarding Trim in your system by running the following commands in your terminal: Open a terminal and do: Terminal Command: systemctl list-timers -a and: Terminal Command: sudo journalctl -u fstrim.timer Top of page Drives & Partitions Let's familiarize with the terms drive, partitions and volumes. They are commonly used terms and understanding\twhat they are will help you in the process of mounting drives/partitions. The term drive refers to a physical storage device such as a hard disk, solid-state disk, removable USB flash drive etc. In Linux, devices are represented by special file system objects called device nodes, which are visible under the /dev directory. Storage devices are labeled under /dev according to the type of device, followed by a letter signifying the order in which they were detected by the system. In Linux the prefix sd is used for all PATA, SATA and SCSI devices. For instance, the device files /dev/sda, /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc correspond to the first, second and third device (drive) respectively. A physical storage device (drive) can be divided into multiple logical storage units known as partitions. Each partition will show up under /dev as a separate device node. A number after the device letter signifies the number of the partition. For example, the device node files /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 refer to the first and second partition of the first device (drive). Note that on PCs using MBR partitioning, due to the limit of four primary partitions and the way extended partitions are handled the partition numbering can slightly differ from the actual partition count. The term volume in Linux is related to the Logical Volume Manager (LVM), which can be used to manage mass storage devices. A physical volume is a storage device or partition. A logical volume created by the LVM is a logical storage device which can span multiple physical volumes. Top of page Mounting Drives & Partitions Mounting drives and partitions in Linux Lite is easy. While the following approach is generally acceptable, it imposes some limitations in the way a drive can be used in your system. For instance, the drive will remain mounted as long as the computer is not restarted or the drive is not manually unmounted. You will need to mount the drive after each reboot. Also, as administrator, you can read and write to the drive but no other user will be able to write to the drive or read any of its content. Read on Automount Drives & Partitions for all users section for other options. By default, all drives connected to your computer will show up on the Desktop as well as in Thunar File Manager, as long as the drive in question contains at least one partition. As you may have noticed in the screenshot above, the drive shown is grayed-out, meaning that it is not mounted by default. To mount a drive in Linux Lite, double click the desired drive and type the administrator password when prompted to do so. Mounting drives requires administrative privileges. Once mounted, the drive icon reflects just that (not longer grayed-out)... you are now ready to use the drive. Top of page Automount Drives & Partitions for all users A more user-friendly way to mount drives in Linux Lite is to have them automount at startup and allow all users to read and write to the drive. The instructions below shows how to mount a drive in Linux Lite with automount options and read and write permissions for all users. You can follow these steps to mount as many partitions as you may need. Start by creating a folder to assign a mount point path to the drive. Open Terminal and execute: Terminal Command: sudo mkdir /media/disk1 ... where disk1 is the name of the folder we are creating and /media is the directory under which it will be created. Then, open Menu, Settings, Disks. Select the disk you want to make available from the left column, then click on Edit Mount Options as shown below. Set the following mount option: 1- Switch off Automatic Mount Options 2- Check Mount at startup 3- Mount options: users,noexec,nosuid 4- Mount Point: /media/disk1 (the path of the folder you created in the previous step) 5- Identify As: /dev/sdb1 (it may be sdb1, sdb2, sdc1 or similar - select from the drop down menu) 6- Filesystem: ' auto ' or ' ext4 ' (Linux) or ' ntfs ' (Windows) if you want to be explicit. Optionally, you could also set a Display Name for your drive, making it easier to identify. The Display Name will be appended to the mount options(3) as you type it. Click OK to apply your changes and enter your password when prompted to do so. Finally, you can either reboot your computer or manually mount the device so that you don't have to reboot. The configured drive will mount automatically on every reboot from there on. All users will be able to read and write on the drive and no prompt for administrative password will be required. To manually mount the drive, click on Mount selected partition (little triangle in the Volumes actions buttons): The selected drive will then be mounted. Repeat these steps to automount other drives (or additional partitions within a drive) as needed. Top of page Automount Windows Partitions for all users Linux Lite can read and write NTFS file systems on external drives by default. To mount a Windows partition, create a new folder to assign a mount point path for the Windows partition. Open Terminal and execute: Terminal Command: sudo mkdir /media/disk1 ... where disk1 is the name of the folder we are creating and /media is the directory under which it will be created. Make sure to create a new folder for each drive you are mounting in your system. For example, assume you are already using /media/disk1 to automount a different drive or partition, you want to have a different folder to assign a mount point path for the Windows partition then; it can be named anything you want: disk2, disk3, windowsdisk, etc. and make sure to adjust the Mount Point options accordingly in the steps below. Next, open Menu, Settings, Disks, select the disk which contains the Windows partition from the left column, highlight (click) the Windows partition and finally click on Edit Mount Options: Set the following mount option: 1- Switch off Automatic Mount Options 2- Check Mount at startup 3- Mount options: defaults 4- Mount Point: /media/disk1 (the path of the folder you previously created) 5- Identify As: /dev/sdb3 (it may be sdb2, sdb3, sdc2 or similar - select it from the drop down menu) 6- Filesystem: ' auto ' or ' ntfs ' (Windows) if you want to be explicit. Click OK to apply your changes and enter your password when prompted to do so. Finally, you can either reboot your computer or manually mount the device so that you don't have to reboot. The configured drive will mount automatically on every reboot from there on. All users will be able to read and write on the drive and no prompt for administrative password will be required. To manually mount the drive, click on Mount selected partition (little triangle in the Volumes actions buttons): The selected drive will then be mounted. Repeat these steps to automount other drives (or additional partitions within a drive) as needed. Top of page Controlling Access to Mounted Drives Usually, you want to mount drives in Linux Lite and make them available to all users. But there are times when controlling access to those drives becomes a necessity. For example, you may want to automount a Windows drive at startup but prevent other users from modifying the contents in that drive; which is certainly important. Maybe you do not want them to see its content at all. There is a simple (yet effective) way for accomplishing just that at the time of mounting drives and partitions; by using uid, gid and umask. A user ID (uid) is a unique positive integer assigned by Linux operating system to each user. Each user is identified to the system by its uid, and user names are generally used only as an interface for humans. The same is true for gid (group ID) but it references groups instead of users. The user file-mode creation mask (umask) is use to determine the file permission for newly created files. It can be used to control the default file permission. Let's put together some examples on how we could set some restrictions at the time of mounting drives. First, we need to know the uid/gid of the administrative account we are using to mount the drive. In this example, our username is liteuser. Open Terminal and execute: Terminal Command: id -u usernameid -g username ... where username is your administrator account username; liteuser in our case. For umask, we are going to go with the most common options you'll usually need: umask 222 - Assigns permissions so that everyone has read-only access for files and directories, including your account. umask 077 - Assigns permissions so that only you have read/write access for files, and read/write/search for directories you own. All others have no access permissions to your files or directories. umask 022 - Assigns permissions so that only you have read/write access for files, and read/write/search for directories you own. All others have read access only to your files, and read/search access to your directories. umask 002 - Assigns permissions so that only you and members of your group have read/write access to files, and read/write/search access to directories you own. All others have read access only to your files, and read/search to your directories. Using Menu, Settings, Disks, mount a drive with some content in it using your uid, gid and umask=077: With the above mount options, this is what liteuser and user1 accounts get to access. Feel free to experiment with umask options, different groups and users. For additional references, see man mount and man umask. Top of page Adding another User To add another User to Linux Lite, click on Menu, Settings, Lite User Manager. Then click on Add New User and enter a name, and the same password twice. Please note, there is a character limit for both your user and the user you are tying to add of 30 characters. If you get an error adding a user, this could be one of the reasons why. To change your own password via the command line, do:. passwd To change someone else's password via the command line (you must have sudo rights to do this), do:. sudo passwd otherusersnamehere And follow the onscreen instructions. NOTE: Choose a strong password, a mix of upper and lower case as well as a mix of numbers and characters. An example of this would be: y%9L2x#o would be considered a strong password. Use a program like KeePassXC to keep all your passwords safely stored and NEVER use the same password for different websites and accounts. Never compromise your security for convenience. You will then be asked for your password, enter it and click on OK to finish creating the new user account. The new user will have the same rights as the default user (you) except for Administrator rights meaning they will be unable to modify system settings such as installing software and changing system files. User Permissions If you want your new user to have Administrator rights, in the right hand pane scroll down to sudo, place a tick in the box beside it and click on Apply. You can give the new user other group permissions to by using this method, but out of the box this should not be necessary as by default, the application already does all this for you. Now when the new user next logs in, they will have the same full system rights as you. You will both be 'Administrators'. Removing a User NOTE: Before removing a user account make sure their files are backed up to a usb device or the cloud first. Removing an account also removes all that persons documents, pictures, videos, files etc. This is as easy as selecting the user that you want to remove from the Select user drop down box, clicking on Remove selected user and clicking on Apply. If you are asked for your password, please enter it and then click Ok. Next a confirmation box will appear, read the message and if you want to proceed click on Yes. The user account and all their data has now been removed. Top of page Resetting your Password Forgot your password? It happens to all of us at some stage. Fortunately setting it again is fairly straight forward. Lets begin. Boot up your computer and immediately press and hold down the Shift or ESC key. You should see a screen like this. Next press the e key whilst that top line is highlighted. This will take you to the next screen. Use your arrow keys to move down to the line highlighted in the picture below. Use the arrow key until you reach the end of that line. Press the backspace key repeatedly until you remove: ro splash quiet $vt_handoff and replace that text with: rw init=/bin/bash so that it looks like the picture below. Now press either F10 or Ctrl+X to boot your machine to a command prompt. At the prompt, type: passwd jerry where jerry is your username, then press enter. You will be asked to type in a new password twice. Your password has now been changed. Now we are ready to save those changes, then reboot the computer.Type in: sync then hit enter. Then type in: reboot -f Your computer will reboot. If you see the screen shown below again, just hit enter. This is normal and won't appear the next time you reboot your computer. You may also not see the boot animation on this boot, this to is normal and will reappear next time you boot up. Now login with your password. Top of page Terminal Basics Linux Lite is designed to be such that new users won't have to venture into the terminal to much. But, there will be some occasions where we need to run the odd terminal command. The following is a very basic introduction to some of the more common terminal commands that will help you to navigate around your computer, should you need to. TIP: instead of typing out the entire name of a file or folder, type the first few letters and hit your TAB key, this will auto complete the name. This will save you lots of time but be careful and make sure you have typed the correct file name. In the examples below 'directory' also means 'folder'. When you first open a terminal, your location in the file system will be your home directory. You can confirm that by using the first command listed below, \"pwd\". It will show that you are in \"/home/username\", where \"username\" is your actual username. pwd - shows you the present working directory (the directory you are currently in). If you get lost, just type \"pwd\" and it will tell you where you are in the file system. ls - display a list of files and directories in the current directory ls -la - a more comprehensive listing that displays file properties in the current directory, including hidden files and their properties. cd - change directory, change to another directory. For instance, if you are currently located at /home/username and want to go to your Documents folder, type: cd Documents. If you then type pwd, you will see that your location is now /home/username/Documents. No matter where you are in the terminal typing just cd will return you to your home folder in the terminal. cd .. - go back one directory (up to the parent directory of your current location). cp - copy file to another directory rm - remove a file or directory rm -rf - permanently delete a file or directory mv - rename a file or directory. You can also use it to move a file from one location to another eg. mv /home/jerry/file1.doc /home/jerry/Documents cat - display the contents inside a file mkdir - make a new folder rmdir - remove a folder killall - kill a program with that name man - read the manual for a particular program (type q to exit the manual) CopyLeft Linux Command Reference: Top of page HOME CONTENTS START INSTALL NETWORK SOFTWARE HARDWARE TUTORIALS CUSTOMIZE GLOSSARY HOME CONTENTS START INSTALL NETWORK SOFTWARE HARDWARE TUTORIALS CUSTOMIZE GLOSSARY HOME CONTENTS START INSTALL NETWORK SOFTWARE HARDWARE TUTORIALS CUSTOMIZE GLOSSARY $(\"span.menu\").click(function(){ $(\".top-nav-in ul\").slideToggle(500, function(){ }); }); HOME CONTENTS START INSTALL NETWORK SOFTWARE HARDWARE TUTORIALS CUSTOMIZE GLOSSARY $(\"span.menu\").click(function(){ $(\".top-nav-in ul\").slideToggle(500, function(){ }); }); Adding another User Enabling TRIM on your SSD Installation Guide Installing Linux Lite to your computer - UEFI Mode Installing Linux Lite to your computer - Legacy BIOS Mode Drives & Partitions - Mounting Drives & Partitions - Automount Drives & Partitions for all users - Automount Windows Partitions for all users - Controlling Access to Mounted Drives - Advanced Users No USB Boot option in the BIOS?

To create a bootable DVD, you need to burn the ISO as an \"image\" to the DVD. Below are listed three free Windows programs that will enable you to do that. If burning to a USB stick, we have also listed a free program that we recommend for doing that in Windows; or a reliable method to create a bootable USB when using a Linux system, or OSX. Once you have your bootable media created, you may need to access your computer's BIOS settings to set the boot order for booting CD/DVD/USB's first (before the hard drive). Typically there will be one or two special keys that can be pressed during initial power-up of the computer (before an operating system starts booting) that will allow you access to either the BIOS Settings/Startup Menu or a separate Boot Menu. Specific keys vary from one manufacturer to the next, so refer to your user manual if you are not sure how to access the settings. Writing the Linux Lite ISO to a USB on Windows A good, simple point and click USB ISO burner is Etcher or Rufus. Links - Etcher Home Page, Rufus Home Page. Guide: - Insert a 4Gb or larger USB stick into your PC. You MUST format the entire USB drive to Fat32 before proceeding. - Install, then start Etcher or Rufus. - Select the Linux Lite ISO file from Etcher or Rufus and write the image to your USB. These instructions are generic for Windows (Rufus is Windows only), Linux and Mac OS. Writing the Linux Lite ISO to a DVD on Windows Here is some free DVD burning software for you to select from: BurnAware Free - http://www.burnaware.com CDBurnerXP - http://cdburnerxp.se/ ImgBurn - http://www.imgburn.com/ Place a blank DVD in your DVD drive, open up the program, select the ISO file that you want to burn. Choose the lowest burn speed, this will greatly reduce the risk of your burn becoming corrupt as can sometimes happen. A 4x or 6x speed is recommended if you have it. The lower the burn speed, the better. Writing the Linux Lite ISO to USB on Linux (see above, the process is similar) Etcher allows you to create a bootable Live USB drive. You will need a 4Gb or larger USB drive. Download Etcher from here. Writing the Linux Lite ISO to USB in Linux and OSX (see above, the process is similar) Using a GUI application You can use Etcher as mentioned above to write the Linux Lite ISO image to a USB. You will need a 4Gb or larger USB drive. Etcher works on - Windows, Mac & Linux. Download it from here. Using a Terminal To find out the letter of your USB stick, open a terminal and type: df -h It is usually listed as /media/yourusername/ or similar. Be very careful to make sure you choose the right drive letter, as you can see in the Filesystem column, my device is /dev/sda1 another clue is the value in the Size column, here it is shown as 7.6G. In this example my device is listed as: /media/jerry/STUFF in the Mounted on column. Open a folder and make sure you are in the directory that the iso file is in. Open a terminal in that directory and type the following: Terminal Command: sudo dd if=linux-lite-6.6-64bit.iso of=/dev/sdx bs=4M Change the x in sdx to match the letter of your USB device. In the above example, my device is shown as sda1 (leave out the '1') Example Terminal Command: sudo dd if=linux-lite-6.6-64bit.iso of=/dev/sda bs=4M The Live DVD/USB image will boot into the desktop automatically, there is no need to login manually. No USB Boot option in the BIOS? Use PloP For full instructions click here. Preparing your Computer for the Installation If you are planning to have Linux Lite as the sole operating system on your computer, there is nothing special you need to do in preparation for the installation, even if another operating system is currently occupying the hard drive. Simply boot up your live installation disk, give Linux Lite a test run if you'd like, then start the installation by double-clicking the Install Linux Lite icon on the desktop. When you get to the Installation Type screen, tell the installer to use the whole disk and it will go ahead and erase anything that is already there, create the partitions needed, format them and install the system automatically. If you currently have one physical hard drive and want to dual-boot Windows and Linux Lite, then you should do a few things to prepare for the installation to insure the best results. Create backup copies of any important data files. (You probably won't need them - but if you do, you'll be glad you made the backups.) Create Windows recovery disk(s) if you haven't already done so before. Defragment your largest Windows partition (likely the \"C: drive\"). If Windows partitions currently span the entire hard drive, one (or more) of its partitions will need to be shrunk down to make room for the Linux installation. Shrink the Windows partition from within Windows disk management. (You can shrink the partition during the installation, but it is probably best to use Windows to shrink Windows partitions.) If you defragmented and shrunk the Windows partition ahead of time, leave the resulting space as unpartitioned, unused, free space. DO NOT create any new partitions from within Windows for the Linux Lite installation. (If you are familiar with partitioning and want to create the partitions ahead of time, use GParted for doing that while booted in the live Linux Lite DVD/USB.) If you plan to have the shrinking done by the installer, it is still recommended that you defragment the Windows partition ahead of time. If you have more than one physical hard drive and want to dual-boot Windows and Linux Lite, with Linux Lite on its own dedicated physical drive, then we recommend you make a request for guidance in our Forum if you are unfamiliar with Linux based installations. Otherwise, general instructions for such an installation are listed below. Choose \"Something else\" on the \"Installation Type\" screen during installation. (See instructions in following section for pictures of installation stages.) On the following page, choose the specific drive that you want for Linux Lite. Create your partitions, choose appropriate file system types, and designate mount points. Near bottom of the window, select a drive for the boot loader installation. (That will be something like /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, etc. - without a partition # after it. Not /dev/sda1, for instance.) It will be pre-filled for the MBR of the first hard drive. If Windows is on the first drive, it's boot loader will be replaced with the Linux boot loader (grub2) unless you specify a different drive. That is fine, but an alternative is to install the boot loader to the Linux hard drive, then set the BIOS to boot from that drive. That will preserve the Windows boot loader on its own drive. Once installation is complete, reboot and the Linux boot loader will have automatically detected your Windows installation and added it to the boot menu choices. Top of page Installing Linux Lite to your computer - UEFI Mode Start your computer, and go into your system BIOS and check that the boot order is set so that DVD and USB devices are set to boot first. This varies from BIOS to BIOS. Refer to your motherboard documentation for more information. You are advised to disable Secure Boot and make sure UEFI is set to Enabled in your BIOS. See here for more information before proceeding if you need any more clarification. Once you are happy with your BIOS set up, insert the DVD disc or USB stick into your computer and reboot your computer. You'll be greeted with the following screen. Let the timer run down if you want to boot to the Live session. Make sure Boot Linux Lite 6.6 Live System is highlighted, press the enter key to boot the Live session. This is also a good way to check that all of your hardware is supported. The other options are: Boot Linux Lite 6.6 Live System - boot directly into the Linux Lite Desktop. Direct install Linux Lite 6.6 - install Linux Lite immediately without booting to the Desktop. Compatibility Mode Linux Lite 6.6 - use this option if you're having trouble with the first 2 options. Check for file system corruption - checks the install image for errors, if none are found, it will boot into the Desktop as per usual. Reboot - restart off your computer. Shutdown - turn off your computer. Some of these boot options may or may not appear as they do in the image above. The types of options varies from release to release. NOTE: If you are having any trouble booting Linux Lite after installation, please read through this trouble shooting guide. The computer will go through the boot up process, this may take anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes depending on your hardware. There will also be a compulsory file check, this is checking all of the files on the DVD or USB to ensure they meet file integrity. It is advised not to skip this procedure. The login for the Live user is automatic, there is no need to login. If for some reason you need to login, simply type in linux beneath Other and click on Log In (no password required). Before we proceed, make sure you have an internet connection first. Click here if you need help to get online before you install Linux Lite. Once you've had a look around Linux Lite and are ready to install the first step is to double click on the Install Linux Lite icon on your Desktop. The installer will then open on the desktop and display the first window of the installer. From here you will select your preferred language and view release notes (option not always available) for this version of Linux Lite. Keyboard layout The next step is to select your keyboard language and layout. You may select the language that your keyboard corresponds to on the left and any specialized layout on the right. This is the point where you may select to enable international keys on your keyboard. Though, these options may be changed later. For a faster install, we recommend you leave the default English (US) options here, and adjust your language settings once Linux Lite has been installed and you have rebooted for the first time. Updates and other software After selecting continue, you are presented with some requirements for the installation. Ensure that these requirements are met by viewing a check mark beside them. You may also choose to download any available updates while installing or install third-party software during the installation. NOTE: 'Download updates while installing Linux' Generally we don't recommend ticking it as this will significantly slow down the install process. Updating after a fresh install is recommended and will save you time in the long run. A typical install on today's hardware will take around 10-15 minutes. If you check these 2 boxes, the install could take over an hour or longer. NOTE: 'Install third-party software for graphics and Wi-Fi hardware and additional media formats' Please verify the legal status of the use of the third party software in your country/territory before choosing this option. This option will install codecs for playing media files, and proprietary drivers for some of your hardware. It is a legal requirement for us to inform you of this. Installation type Now it is time to choose the method of installing Linux Lite to your hard disk. You will have several options during this phase of the installer. Erase Disk and Install Linux NOTE: This option will erase your entire hard drive. Make sure this is what you want to do before proceeding. Upon selecting Erase Disk, the installer will automatically select the default partitioning scheme. Click on Install Now to accept the changes. NOTE: This installation option will automatically install the Linux bootloader to the first hard drive on the system. That is typically how most people install and the Linux boot loader offers the choice of booting any other operating systems that are on your computer. However, if your intent is to keep the Windows boot loader in charge of booting the Windows drive and the Windows drive is the first one, then you need to use the 'Something else' installation type. That way you can control the 'Device for boot loader installation' and set it for the specific drive you choose for Linux Lite. Advanced features There are 2 options in here. Use LVM with the new Linux installation and EXPERIMENTAL: Erase disk and use ZFS. ZFS is an advanced filesystem usually found in Servers. Unless you are familiar with ZFS, there is absolutely no need to use it, doing so could corrupt your system if you don't know what you are doing. NOTE: If you choose the Use LVM with the new Linux installation you will be prompted to enter a strong password. This will option will encrypt your entire Linux Lite install. Encrypting is optional and only recommended for people who understand the encryption process. Selecting Erase disk and install Linux will automatically partition your hard drive as shown below. Something else (dual booting or custom partitioning) Select Something else from this screen if you wish to dual boot with Windows or edit existing partitions (or both). Keeping Windows (dual booting) When manual partitioning, set 500mb of space on sda1 as a EFI System Partition (No Windows operating system installed). If you are dual-booting, create a separate partition, do not use sda1. In this example, we have 3 partitions. sda1 - The recovery partition for Windows. sda2 - Where Windows is installed (note ntfs is the Type). sda3 - The spare, unformatted partition. This is where we will install Linux Lite to. Click on the sda3 partition and click the Change button. Select Ext4 journaling file system, place a tick in Format the partition and select / as the Mount point. Click OK. NOTE: If you have any other NTFS drives, it is important to give these a mount point during the install. That way they will be easily accessible after the installation. The mount point is simply \"where\" in the file system you want that partition's files to show up. You can name the mount point what ever you want, be sure to give it a simple, no spaces lowercase name like eg. /myntfs do not use /My NTFS. DO NOT select 'Format the partition' when editing any NTFS partitions. NOTE: If you are manual partitioning here, make sure in the 'Device for boot loader installation:' drop down, you select /dev/sda. Grub must be installed here to the root sda device or you will have trouble booting. This is the case for ALL partitioning options. When you have finished, click on Install Now. Overwriting Windows In this example, we select the sda2 partition (where Windows is installed) and click the Change button. Select Ext4 journaling file system, place a tick in Format the partition and select / as the Mount point. Click OK. NOTE: Device for boot loader installation. The Linux boot loader offers the choice of booting any other operating systems that are on your computer. In this example since we are over writing Windows, we simply select sda for the boot loader. Whichever method you choose, once you are finished, click on Install Now. Where are you? After completing the partitioning phase of the installation, you are prompted to set up some personal details about the system. The installer will continue to work in the background while you are filling out this information. The first step is to select your time zone. The installer may detect your time zone based on your location via your ISP's information. If not, you may select your time zone by either clicking on your region on the supplied map or by typing in your area in the box below. Who are you? On the next screen, you are greeted by several fields to fill. These fields include: Your name - your real, full name. Your computer's name - the name that you wish to use to identify the computer on your network. Pick a username - your user name that is used to login to the system. Choose a password - your password that you wish to use for your user and sudo (administrator) password. Confirm your password - enter the above password again. NOTE: Choose a strong password, a mix of upper and lower case as well as a mix of numbers and characters. An example of this would be: y%9L2x#o would be considered a strong password. Use a program like KeePassXC to keep all your passwords safely stored and NEVER use the same password for different websites. (KeePassXC is available for installation from Menu, Settings, Lite Software. You do not need to download it from their website.) NEVER COMPROMISE YOUR SECURITY FOR CONVENIENCE. There are also options to enable auto-login for your user or have the computer prompt you for a password everytime you login. If you have a webcam, you may encounter a screen during the install asking to Take a photo this feature is supported so that when you first log in, your photo will be displayed as your avatar. If you skip this step, you can use a .png photo of yourself, rename it to .face and place it in your /home/user folder. By default, the Linux Lite logo will represent your login icon. After finishing all of these steps you will be greeted with a slideshow detailing all of the features and software that are included in this version of Linux Lite. You may allow them to play on their own or navigate through them using the arrow buttons on the sides of the window (the picture below may vary from version to version). Once the installation is complete you will be prompted to either restart your computer and begin using your newly installed Linux Lite system or to continue using the testing environment on the DVD/USB that you are using. If for some reason your computer hangs on restart, press F4 or Enter. After a reboot you will be greeted by the login screen: After you have logged in you will see the desktop and Welcome window. Be sure to read through the Welcome window to get you off to the best possible start to using Linux Lite. Install Updates - do this first (reboot if prompted to after updates have finished). Install Drivers - see if there are any drivers needed for your computer. Set a Restore Point - set your first restore point using Timeshift, similar to System Restore in Windows. Install Language Support - if you are using anything other than English. Select Dark or Light Theme - self explanatory. Installing Linux Lite to your computer - Legacy BIOS Mode Once you are happy with your BIOS set up, insert the DVD disc or USB stick into your computer and reboot your computer. You'll be greeted with the following screen. Let the timer run down if you want to boot to the Live session. Make sure Boot Linux Lite 6.6 Live System is highlighted, press the enter key to boot the Live session. This is also a good way to check that all of your hardware is supported. If you are having trouble booting and you get just a black screen, try the second option, Compatibility Mode Linux Lite 6.6. The other options are: Boot Linux Lite 6.6 Live System - boot directly into the Linux Lite Desktop. Direct install Linux Lite 6.6 - install Linux Lite immediately without booting to the Desktop. Compatibility Mode Linux Lite 6.6 - use this option if you're having trouble with the first 2 options.

Linux Lite is based off Ubuntu and from time to time there may be some mixed branding. You can now log into your computer and start using it. Top of page Securely Erasing files Permanently The following tutorial explains how to set up and securely erase files on Linux Lite. This method will ensure that even with data recovery software, files will be irretrievable. 1. Open your home folder, go to: Edit, Configure custom actions... 2. Click the + symbol in the top right, and enter the following details as shown in the picture below on the Basic tab: Name: Shred file... Description: Securely erase files permanently Command: shred -u %F (the icon chosen here is emblem-important from All Icons) 3. In the Appearance Conditions tab, select the following: File Pattern: * Click on Ok and Close when finished. Now when you want to permanently and securely erase a file from your computer without the chance of recovery, right click any number of files and select Shred file... Top of page Setting your Language Here's how to set a language system wide following an install of Linux Lite. 1. Click on Menu, Settings, Language Support. 2. You will get a dialog box pop up, click on Remind Me Later. 3. Now click on the button Install / Remove Languages. 4. In this example, we'll install the Portuguese language. Scroll down, find your language and tick the box next to it, then click on Apply. You'll then be prompted for your password. After you've entered your password, your computer will begin to download all the language files, this may take a while. 6. Once that is done, scroll to the bottom of the Language for menus and windows box and drag your newly installed language to the top of the list. Then click on Apply System-Wide, you'll be prompted for your password again. Now wait for the settings to be applied, it will take a few moments. 7. Now click on the Regional Formats tab, select the language you just installed, and click on Apply System-Wide. Enter your password again if prompted to. 8. Now logout and login again and you will see that your new language has been applied. Please note that not all programs may not have your language applied. If this is the case, search for that program in Package Manager and see if there is a language pack available for it. Also note that after you have changed your language, some of the Menu items may not be translated properly. There is little we can do about this, an easy way to rename Menu entries is by going to Menu, Settings, Menu Editor and editing the entries there. Top of page Enabling TRIM on your SSD Trim in Linux Lite Series 5.x and onwards is now a SystemD service that runs automatically weekly. There is no need to set up Trim anymore in Linux Lite. You can get further information regarding Trim in your system by running the following commands in your terminal: Open a terminal and do: Terminal Command: systemctl list-timers -a and: Terminal Command: sudo journalctl -u fstrim.timer Top of page Drives & Partitions Let's familiarize with the terms drive, partitions and volumes. They are commonly used terms and understanding\twhat they are will help you in the process of mounting drives/partitions. The term drive refers to a physical storage device such as a hard disk, solid-state disk, removable USB flash drive etc. In Linux, devices are represented by special file system objects called device nodes, which are visible under the /dev directory. Storage devices are labeled under /dev according to the type of device, followed by a letter signifying the order in which they were detected by the system. In Linux the prefix sd is used for all PATA, SATA and SCSI devices. For instance, the device files /dev/sda, /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc correspond to the first, second and third device (drive) respectively. A physical storage device (drive) can be divided into multiple logical storage units known as partitions. Each partition will show up under /dev as a separate device node. A number after the device letter signifies the number of the partition. For example, the device node files /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 refer to the first and second partition of the first device (drive). Note that on PCs using MBR partitioning, due to the limit of four primary partitions and the way extended partitions are handled the partition numbering can slightly differ from the actual partition count. The term volume in Linux is related to the Logical Volume Manager (LVM), which can be used to manage mass storage devices. A physical volume is a storage device or partition. A logical volume created by the LVM is a logical storage device which can span multiple physical volumes. Top of page Mounting Drives & Partitions Mounting drives and partitions in Linux Lite is easy. While the following approach is generally acceptable, it imposes some limitations in the way a drive can be used in your system. For instance, the drive will remain mounted as long as the computer is not restarted or the drive is not manually unmounted. You will need to mount the drive after each reboot. Also, as administrator, you can read and write to the drive but no other user will be able to write to the drive or read any of its content. Read on Automount Drives & Partitions for all users section for other options. By default, all drives connected to your computer will show up on the Desktop as well as in Thunar File Manager, as long as the drive in question contains at least one partition. As you may have noticed in the screenshot above, the drive shown is grayed-out, meaning that it is not mounted by default. To mount a drive in Linux Lite, double click the desired drive and type the administrator password when prompted to do so. Mounting drives requires administrative privileges. Once mounted, the drive icon reflects just that (not longer grayed-out)... you are now ready to use the drive. Top of page Automount Drives & Partitions for all users A more user-friendly way to mount drives in Linux Lite is to have them automount at startup and allow all users to read and write to the drive. The instructions below shows how to mount a drive in Linux Lite with automount options and read and write permissions for all users. You can follow these steps to mount as many partitions as you may need. Start by creating a folder to assign a mount point path to the drive. Open Terminal and execute: Terminal Command: sudo mkdir /media/disk1 ... where disk1 is the name of the folder we are creating and /media is the directory under which it will be created. Then, open Menu, Settings, Disks. Select the disk you want to make available from the left column, then click on Edit Mount Options as shown below. Set the following mount option: 1- Switch off Automatic Mount Options 2- Check Mount at startup 3- Mount options: users,noexec,nosuid 4- Mount Point: /media/disk1 (the path of the folder you created in the previous step) 5- Identify As: /dev/sdb1 (it may be sdb1, sdb2, sdc1 or similar - select from the drop down menu) 6- Filesystem: ' auto ' or ' ext4 ' (Linux) or ' ntfs ' (Windows) if you want to be explicit. Optionally, you could also set a Display Name for your drive, making it easier to identify. The Display Name will be appended to the mount options(3) as you type it. Click OK to apply your changes and enter your password when prompted to do so. Finally, you can either reboot your computer or manually mount the device so that you don't have to reboot. The configured drive will mount automatically on every reboot from there on. All users will be able to read and write on the drive and no prompt for administrative password will be required. To manually mount the drive, click on Mount selected partition (little triangle in the Volumes actions buttons): The selected drive will then be mounted. Repeat these steps to automount other drives (or additional partitions within a drive) as needed. Top of page Automount Windows Partitions for all users Linux Lite can read and write NTFS file systems on external drives by default. To mount a Windows partition, create a new folder to assign a mount point path for the Windows partition. Open Terminal and execute: Terminal Command: sudo mkdir /media/disk1 ... where disk1 is the name of the folder we are creating and /media is the directory under which it will be created. Make sure to create a new folder for each drive you are mounting in your system. For example, assume you are already using /media/disk1 to automount a different drive or partition, you want to have a different folder to assign a mount point path for the Windows partition then; it can be named anything you want: disk2, disk3, windowsdisk, etc. and make sure to adjust the Mount Point options accordingly in the steps below. Next, open Menu, Settings, Disks, select the disk which contains the Windows partition from the left column, highlight (click) the Windows partition and finally click on Edit Mount Options: Set the following mount option: 1- Switch off Automatic Mount Options 2- Check Mount at startup 3- Mount options: defaults 4- Mount Point: /media/disk1 (the path of the folder you previously created) 5- Identify As: /dev/sdb3 (it may be sdb2, sdb3, sdc2 or similar - select it from the drop down menu) 6- Filesystem: ' auto ' or ' ntfs ' (Windows) if you want to be explicit. Click OK to apply your changes and enter your password when prompted to do so. Finally, you can either reboot your computer or manually mount the device so that you don't have to reboot. The configured drive will mount automatically on every reboot from there on. All users will be able to read and write on the drive and no prompt for administrative password will be required. To manually mount the drive, click on Mount selected partition (little triangle in the Volumes actions buttons): The selected drive will then be mounted. Repeat these steps to automount other drives (or additional partitions within a drive) as needed. Top of page Controlling Access to Mounted Drives Usually, you want to mount drives in Linux Lite and make them available to all users. But there are times when controlling access to those drives becomes a necessity. For example, you may want to automount a Windows drive at startup but prevent other users from modifying the contents in that drive; which is certainly important. Maybe you do not want them to see its content at all. There is a simple (yet effective) way for accomplishing just that at the time of mounting drives and partitions; by using uid, gid and umask. A user ID (uid) is a unique positive integer assigned by Linux operating system to each user. Each user is identified to the system by its uid, and user names are generally used only as an interface for humans. The same is true for gid (group ID) but it references groups instead of users. The user file-mode creation mask (umask) is use to determine the file permission for newly created files. It can be used to control the default file permission. Let's put together some examples on how we could set some restrictions at the time of mounting drives. First, we need to know the uid/gid of the administrative account we are using to mount the drive. In this example, our username is liteuser. Open Terminal and execute: Terminal Command: id -u usernameid -g username ... where username is your administrator account username; liteuser in our case. For umask, we are going to go with the most common options you'll usually need: umask 222 - Assigns permissions so that everyone has read-only access for files and directories, including your account. umask 077 - Assigns permissions so that only you have read/write access for files, and read/write/search for directories you own. All others have no access permissions to your files or directories. umask 022 - Assigns permissions so that only you have read/write access for files, and read/write/search for directories you own. All others have read access only to your files, and read/search access to your directories. umask 002 - Assigns permissions so that only you and members of your group have read/write access to files, and read/write/search access to directories you own. All others have read access only to your files, and read/search to your directories. Using Menu, Settings, Disks, mount a drive with some content in it using your uid, gid and umask=077: With the above mount options, this is what liteuser and user1 accounts get to access. Feel free to experiment with umask options, different groups and users. For additional references, see man mount and man umask. Top of page Adding another User To add another User to Linux Lite, click on Menu, Settings, Lite User Manager. Then click on Add New User and enter a name, and the same password twice. Please note, there is a character limit for both your user and the user you are tying to add of 30 characters. If you get an error adding a user, this could be one of the reasons why. To change your own password via the command line, do:. passwd To change someone else's password via the command line (you must have sudo rights to do this), do:. sudo passwd otherusersnamehere And follow the onscreen instructions. NOTE: Choose a strong password, a mix of upper and lower case as well as a mix of numbers and characters. An example of this would be: y%9L2x#o would be considered a strong password. Use a program like KeePassXC to keep all your passwords safely stored and NEVER use the same password for different websites and accounts. Never compromise your security for convenience. You will then be asked for your password, enter it and click on OK to finish creating the new user account. The new user will have the same rights as the default user (you) except for Administrator rights meaning they will be unable to modify system settings such as installing software and changing system files. User Permissions If you want your new user to have Administrator rights, in the right hand pane scroll down to sudo, place a tick in the box beside it and click on Apply. You can give the new user other group permissions to by using this method, but out of the box this should not be necessary as by default, the application already does all this for you. Now when the new user next logs in, they will have the same full system rights as you. You will both be 'Administrators'. Removing a User NOTE: Before removing a user account make sure their files are backed up to a usb device or the cloud first. Removing an account also removes all that persons documents, pictures, videos, files etc. This is as easy as selecting the user that you want to remove from the Select user drop down box, clicking on Remove selected user and clicking on Apply. If you are asked for your password, please enter it and then click Ok. Next a confirmation box will appear, read the message and if you want to proceed click on Yes. The user account and all their data has now been removed. Top of page Resetting your Password Forgot your password? It happens to all of us at some stage. Fortunately setting it again is fairly straight forward. Lets begin. Boot up your computer and immediately press and hold down the Shift or ESC key. You should see a screen like this. Next press the e key whilst that top line is highlighted. This will take you to the next screen. Use your arrow keys to move down to the line highlighted in the picture below. Use the arrow key until you reach the end of that line. Press the backspace key repeatedly until you remove: ro splash quiet $vt_handoff and replace that text with: rw init=/bin/bash so that it looks like the picture below. Now press either F10 or Ctrl+X to boot your machine to a command prompt. At the prompt, type: passwd jerry where jerry is your username, then press enter. You will be asked to type in a new password twice. Your password has now been changed. Now we are ready to save those changes, then reboot the computer.Type in: sync then hit enter. Then type in: reboot -f Your computer will reboot. If you see the screen shown below again, just hit enter. This is normal and won't appear the next time you reboot your computer. You may also not see the boot animation on this boot, this to is normal and will reappear next time you boot up. Now login with your password. Top of page Terminal Basics Linux Lite is designed to be such that new users won't have to venture into the terminal to much. But, there will be some occasions where we need to run the odd terminal command. The following is a very basic introduction to some of the more common terminal commands that will help you to navigate around your computer, should you need to. TIP: instead of typing out the entire name of a file or folder, type the first few letters and hit your TAB key, this will auto complete the name. This will save you lots of time but be careful and make sure you have typed the correct file name. In the examples below 'directory' also means 'folder'. When you first open a terminal, your location in the file system will be your home directory. You can confirm that by using the first command listed below, \"pwd\". It will show that you are in \"/home/username\", where \"username\" is your actual username. pwd - shows you the present working directory (the directory you are currently in). If you get lost, just type \"pwd\" and it will tell you where you are in the file system. ls - display a list of files and directories in the current directory ls -la - a more comprehensive listing that displays file properties in the current directory, including hidden files and their properties. cd - change directory, change to another directory. For instance, if you are currently located at /home/username and want to go to your Documents folder, type: cd Documents. If you then type pwd, you will see that your location is now /home/username/Documents. No matter where you are in the terminal typing just cd will return you to your home folder in the terminal. cd .. - go back one directory (up to the parent directory of your current location). cp - copy file to another directory rm - remove a file or directory rm -rf - permanently delete a file or directory mv - rename a file or directory. You can also use it to move a file from one location to another eg. mv /home/jerry/file1.doc /home/jerry/Documents cat - display the contents inside a file mkdir - make a new folder rmdir - remove a folder killall - kill a program with that name man - read the manual for a particular program (type q to exit the manual) CopyLeft Linux Command Reference: Top of page Adding another User Enabling TRIM on your SSD Installation Guide Installing Linux Lite to your computer - UEFI Mode Installing Linux Lite to your computer - Legacy BIOS Mode Drives & Partitions - Mounting Drives & Partitions - Automount Drives & Partitions for all users - Automount Windows Partitions for all users - Controlling Access to Mounted Drives - Advanced Users No USB Boot option in the BIOS?

To create a bootable DVD, you need to burn the ISO as an \"image\" to the DVD. Below are listed three free Windows programs that will enable you to do that. If burning to a USB stick, we have also listed a free program that we recommend for doing that in Windows; or a reliable method to create a bootable USB when using a Linux system, or OSX. Once you have your bootable media created, you may need to access your computer's BIOS settings to set the boot order for booting CD/DVD/USB's first (before the hard drive). Typically there will be one or two special keys that can be pressed during initial power-up of the computer (before an operating system starts booting) that will allow you access to either the BIOS Settings/Startup Menu or a separate Boot Menu. Specific keys vary from one manufacturer to the next, so refer to your user manual if you are not sure how to access the settings. Writing the Linux Lite ISO to a USB on Windows A good, simple point and click USB ISO burner is Etcher or Rufus. Links - Etcher Home Page, Rufus Home Page. Guide: - Insert a 4Gb or larger USB stick into your PC. You MUST format the entire USB drive to Fat32 before proceeding. - Install, then start Etcher or Rufus. - Select the Linux Lite ISO file from Etcher or Rufus and write the image to your USB. These instructions are generic for Windows (Rufus is Windows only), Linux and Mac OS. Writing the Linux Lite ISO to a DVD on Windows Here is some free DVD burning software for you to select from: BurnAware Free - http://www.burnaware.com CDBurnerXP - http://cdburnerxp.se/ ImgBurn - http://www.imgburn.com/ Place a blank DVD in your DVD drive, open up the program, select the ISO file that you want to burn. Choose the lowest burn speed, this will greatly reduce the risk of your burn becoming corrupt as can sometimes happen. A 4x or 6x speed is recommended if you have it. The lower the burn speed, the better. Writing the Linux Lite ISO to USB on Linux (see above, the process is similar) Etcher allows you to create a bootable Live USB drive. You will need a 4Gb or larger USB drive. Download Etcher from here. Writing the Linux Lite ISO to USB in Linux and OSX (see above, the process is similar) Using a GUI application You can use Etcher as mentioned above to write the Linux Lite ISO image to a USB. You will need a 4Gb or larger USB drive. Etcher works on - Windows, Mac & Linux. Download it from here. Using a Terminal To find out the letter of your USB stick, open a terminal and type: df -h It is usually listed as /media/yourusername/ or similar. Be very careful to make sure you choose the right drive letter, as you can see in the Filesystem column, my device is /dev/sda1 another clue is the value in the Size column, here it is shown as 7.6G. In this example my device is listed as: /media/jerry/STUFF in the Mounted on column. Open a folder and make sure you are in the directory that the iso file is in. Open a terminal in that directory and type the following: Terminal Command: sudo dd if=linux-lite-6.6-64bit.iso of=/dev/sdx bs=4M Change the x in sdx to match the letter of your USB device. In the above example, my device is shown as sda1 (leave out the '1') Example Terminal Command: sudo dd if=linux-lite-6.6-64bit.iso of=/dev/sda bs=4M The Live DVD/USB image will boot into the desktop automatically, there is no need to login manually. No USB Boot option in the BIOS? Use PloP For full instructions click here. Preparing your Computer for the Installation If you are planning to have Linux Lite as the sole operating system on your computer, there is nothing special you need to do in preparation for the installation, even if another operating system is currently occupying the hard drive. Simply boot up your live installation disk, give Linux Lite a test run if you'd like, then start the installation by double-clicking the Install Linux Lite icon on the desktop. When you get to the Installation Type screen, tell the installer to use the whole disk and it will go ahead and erase anything that is already there, create the partitions needed, format them and install the system automatically. If you currently have one physical hard drive and want to dual-boot Windows and Linux Lite, then you should do a few things to prepare for the installation to insure the best results. Create backup copies of any important data files. (You probably won't need them - but if you do, you'll be glad you made the backups.) Create Windows recovery disk(s) if you haven't already done so before. Defragment your largest Windows partition (likely the \"C: drive\"). If Windows partitions currently span the entire hard drive, one (or more) of its partitions will need to be shrunk down to make room for the Linux installation. Shrink the Windows partition from within Windows disk management. (You can shrink the partition during the installation, but it is probably best to use Windows to shrink Windows partitions.) If you defragmented and shrunk the Windows partition ahead of time, leave the resulting space as unpartitioned, unused, free space. DO NOT create any new partitions from within Windows for the Linux Lite installation. (If you are familiar with partitioning and want to create the partitions ahead of time, use GParted for doing that while booted in the live Linux Lite DVD/USB.) If you plan to have the shrinking done by the installer, it is still recommended that you defragment the Windows partition ahead of time. If you have more than one physical hard drive and want to dual-boot Windows and Linux Lite, with Linux Lite on its own dedicated physical drive, then we recommend you make a request for guidance in our Forum if you are unfamiliar with Linux based installations. Otherwise, general instructions for such an installation are listed below. Choose \"Something else\" on the \"Installation Type\" screen during installation. (See instructions in following section for pictures of installation stages.) On the following page, choose the specific drive that you want for Linux Lite. Create your partitions, choose appropriate file system types, and designate mount points. Near bottom of the window, select a drive for the boot loader installation. (That will be something like /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, etc. - without a partition # after it. Not /dev/sda1, for instance.) It will be pre-filled for the MBR of the first hard drive. If Windows is on the first drive, it's boot loader will be replaced with the Linux boot loader (grub2) unless you specify a different drive. That is fine, but an alternative is to install the boot loader to the Linux hard drive, then set the BIOS to boot from that drive. That will preserve the Windows boot loader on its own drive. Once installation is complete, reboot and the Linux boot loader will have automatically detected your Windows installation and added it to the boot menu choices. Top of page Installing Linux Lite to your computer - UEFI Mode Start your computer, and go into your system BIOS and check that the boot order is set so that DVD and USB devices are set to boot first. This varies from BIOS to BIOS. Refer to your motherboard documentation for more information. You are advised to disable Secure Boot and make sure UEFI is set to Enabled in your BIOS. See here for more information before proceeding if you need any more clarification. Once you are happy with your BIOS set up, insert the DVD disc or USB stick into your computer and reboot your computer. You'll be greeted with the following screen. Let the timer run down if you want to boot to the Live session. Make sure Boot Linux Lite 6.6 Live System is highlighted, press the enter key to boot the Live session. This is also a good way to check that all of your hardware is supported. The other options are: Boot Linux Lite 6.6 Live System - boot directly into the Linux Lite Desktop. Direct install Linux Lite 6.6 - install Linux Lite immediately without booting to the Desktop. Compatibility Mode Linux Lite 6.6 - use this option if you're having trouble with the first 2 options. Check for file system corruption - checks the install image for errors, if none are found, it will boot into the Desktop as per usual. Reboot - restart off your computer. Shutdown - turn off your computer. Some of these boot options may or may not appear as they do in the image above. The types of options varies from release to release. NOTE: If you are having any trouble booting Linux Lite after installation, please read through this trouble shooting guide. The computer will go through the boot up process, this may take anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes depending on your hardware. There will also be a compulsory file check, this is checking all of the files on the DVD or USB to ensure they meet file integrity. It is advised not to skip this procedure. The login for the Live user is automatic, there is no need to login. If for some reason you need to login, simply type in linux beneath Other and click on Log In (no password required). Before we proceed, make sure you have an internet connection first. Click here if you need help to get online before you install Linux Lite. Once you've had a look around Linux Lite and are ready to install the first step is to double click on the Install Linux Lite icon on your Desktop. The installer will then open on the desktop and display the first window of the installer. From here you will select your preferred language and view release notes (option not always available) for this version of Linux Lite. Keyboard layout The next step is to select your keyboard language and layout. You may select the language that your keyboard corresponds to on the left and any specialized layout on the right. This is the point where you may select to enable international keys on your keyboard. Though, these options may be changed later. For a faster install, we recommend you leave the default English (US) options here, and adjust your language settings once Linux Lite has been installed and you have rebooted for the first time. Updates and other software After selecting continue, you are presented with some requirements for the installation. Ensure that these requirements are met by viewing a check mark beside them. You may also choose to download any available updates while installing or install third-party software during the installation. NOTE: 'Download updates while installing Linux' Generally we don't recommend ticking it as this will significantly slow down the install process. Updating after a fresh install is recommended and will save you time in the long run. A typical install on today's hardware will take around 10-15 minutes. If you check these 2 boxes, the install could take over an hour or longer. NOTE: 'Install third-party software for graphics and Wi-Fi hardware and additional media formats' Please verify the legal status of the use of the third party software in your country/territory before choosing this option. This option will install codecs for playing media files, and proprietary drivers for some of your hardware. It is a legal requirement for us to inform you of this. Installation type Now it is time to choose the method of installing Linux Lite to your hard disk. You will have several options during this phase of the installer. Erase Disk and Install Linux NOTE: This option will erase your entire hard drive. Make sure this is what you want to do before proceeding. Upon selecting Erase Disk, the installer will automatically select the default partitioning scheme. Click on Install Now to accept the changes. NOTE: This installation option will automatically install the Linux bootloader to the first hard drive on the system. That is typically how most people install and the Linux boot loader offers the choice of booting any other operating systems that are on your computer. However, if your intent is to keep the Windows boot loader in charge of booting the Windows drive and the Windows drive is the first one, then you need to use the 'Something else' installation type. That way you can control the 'Device for boot loader installation' and set it for the specific drive you choose for Linux Lite. Advanced features There are 2 options in here. Use LVM with the new Linux installation and EXPERIMENTAL: Erase disk and use ZFS. ZFS is an advanced filesystem usually found in Servers. Unless you are familiar with ZFS, there is absolutely no need to use it, doing so could corrupt your system if you don't know what you are doing. NOTE: If you choose the Use LVM with the new Linux installation you will be prompted to enter a strong password. This will option will encrypt your entire Linux Lite install. Encrypting is optional and only recommended for people who understand the encryption process. Selecting Erase disk and install Linux will automatically partition your hard drive as shown below. Something else (dual booting or custom partitioning) Select Something else from this screen if you wish to dual boot with Windows or edit existing partitions (or both). Keeping Windows (dual booting) When manual partitioning, set 500mb of space on sda1 as a EFI System Partition (No Windows operating system installed). If you are dual-booting, create a separate partition, do not use sda1. In this example, we have 3 partitions. sda1 - The recovery partition for Windows. sda2 - Where Windows is installed (note ntfs is the Type). sda3 - The spare, unformatted partition. This is where we will install Linux Lite to. Click on the sda3 partition and click the Change button. Select Ext4 journaling file system, place a tick in Format the partition and select / as the Mount point. Click OK. NOTE: If you have any other NTFS drives, it is important to give these a mount point during the install. That way they will be easily accessible after the installation. The mount point is simply \"where\" in the file system you want that partition's files to show up. You can name the mount point what ever you want, be sure to give it a simple, no spaces lowercase name like eg. /myntfs do not use /My NTFS. DO NOT select 'Format the partition' when editing any NTFS partitions. NOTE: If you are manual partitioning here, make sure in the 'Device for boot loader installation:' drop down, you select /dev/sda. Grub must be installed here to the root sda device or you will have trouble booting. This is the case for ALL partitioning options. When you have finished, click on Install Now. Overwriting Windows In this example, we select the sda2 partition (where Windows is installed) and click the Change button. Select Ext4 journaling file system, place a tick in Format the partition and select / as the Mount point. Click OK. NOTE: Device for boot loader installation. The Linux boot loader offers the choice of booting any other operating systems that are on your computer. In this example since we are over writing Windows, we simply select sda for the boot loader. Whichever method you choose, once you are finished, click on Install Now. Where are you? After completing the partitioning phase of the installation, you are prompted to set up some personal details about the system. The installer will continue to work in the background while you are filling out this information. The first step is to select your time zone. The installer may detect your time zone based on your location via your ISP's information. If not, you may select your time zone by either clicking on your region on the supplied map or by typing in your area in the box below. Who are you? On the next screen, you are greeted by several fields to fill. These fields include: Your name - your real, full name. Your computer's name - the name that you wish to use to identify the computer on your network. Pick a username - your user name that is used to login to the system. Choose a password - your password that you wish to use for your user and sudo (administrator) password. Confirm your password - enter the above password again. NOTE: Choose a strong password, a mix of upper and lower case as well as a mix of numbers and characters. An example of this would be: y%9L2x#o would be considered a strong password. Use a program like KeePassXC to keep all your passwords safely stored and NEVER use the same password for different websites. (KeePassXC is available for installation from Menu, Settings, Lite Software. You do not need to download it from their website.) NEVER COMPROMISE YOUR SECURITY FOR CONVENIENCE. There are also options to enable auto-login for your user or have the computer prompt you for a password everytime you login. If you have a webcam, you may encounter a screen during the install asking to Take a photo this feature is supported so that when you first log in, your photo will be displayed as your avatar. If you skip this step, you can use a .png photo of yourself, rename it to .face and place it in your /home/user folder. By default, the Linux Lite logo will represent your login icon. After finishing all of these steps you will be greeted with a slideshow detailing all of the features and software that are included in this version of Linux Lite. You may allow them to play on their own or navigate through them using the arrow buttons on the sides of the window (the picture below may vary from version to version). Once the installation is complete you will be prompted to either restart your computer and begin using your newly installed Linux Lite system or to continue using the testing environment on the DVD/USB that you are using. If for some reason your computer hangs on restart, press F4 or Enter. After a reboot you will be greeted by the login screen: After you have logged in you will see the desktop and Welcome window. Be sure to read through the Welcome window to get you off to the best possible start to using Linux Lite. Install Updates - do this first (reboot if prompted to after updates have finished). Install Drivers - see if there are any drivers needed for your computer. Set a Restore Point - set your first restore point using Timeshift, similar to System Restore in Windows. Install Language Support - if you are using anything other than English. Select Dark or Light Theme - self explanatory. Installing Linux Lite to your computer - Legacy BIOS Mode Once you are happy with your BIOS set up, insert the DVD disc or USB stick into your computer and reboot your computer. You'll be greeted with the following screen. Let the timer run down if you want to boot to the Live session. Make sure Boot Linux Lite 6.6 Live System is highlighted, press the enter key to boot the Live session. This is also a good way to check that all of your hardware is supported. If you are having trouble booting and you get just a black screen, try the second option, Compatibility Mode Linux Lite 6.6. The other options are: Boot Linux Lite 6.6 Live System - boot directly into the Linux Lite Desktop. Direct install Linux Lite 6.6 - install Linux Lite immediately without booting to the Desktop. Compatibility Mode Linux Lite 6.6 - use this option if you're having trouble with the first 2 options.

If for some reason your computer hangs on restart, press F4 or Enter. NOTE: There will be no prompt to remove your DVD or USB after installation so remember to remove your DVD or USB as soon as your pc reboots. After a reboot you will be greeted by the login screen: After you have logged in you will see the desktop and Welcome window. Be sure to read through the Welcome window to get you off to the best possible start to using Linux Lite. Install Updates - do this first (reboot if prompted to after updates have finished). Install Drivers - see if there are any drivers needed for your computer. Set a Restore Point - set your first restore point using Timeshift, similar to System Restore in Windows. Install Language Support - if you are using anything other than English. Select Dark or Light Theme - self explanatory. OEM Install (not in Series 6x) NOTE: You MUST use an Ethernet connection for this process, do not use WiFi. NOTE: These instructions have been left here as a reference for previous Series of Linux Lite where the OEM install option is still available. Some of the wording and screenshots information may differ. Choose - OEM install Linux Lite 6.6 (for manufacturers) from the Boot menu. Wait for the filesystem check to complete. Boot menu: Select your Language, then in the box enter in your computer distribution/company name. Here we will use ACME as our company name. On the next screen, choose your keyboard. Check Download updates while installing Linux. Check Erase disk and install Linux, then click in Install Now. Select your Region. You only need to enter a password on this next box. This password is temporary and is used by the OEM later on. The install will now complete. Eject the install media, and reboot. As the OEM, click on Menu, Accessories, Prepare for Shipping or use the shortcut on the Desktop as shown below. Enter the password you created during the previous install process. The following box will pop up when the process has finished. Click OK, shutdown the machine and prepare your computer for shipping/delivery. Customer Turn on your computer and wait for it to start up. Once it has started, select your language. Click on Continue. Select your Keyboard layout. Select your Region. Enter your details, including a good, strong password. The system will now complete the installation process. If you see some Ubuntu branded slides, just ignore them. Linux Lite is based off Ubuntu and from time to time there may be some mixed branding. You can now log into your computer and start using it. Top of page Securely Erasing files Permanently The following tutorial explains how to set up and securely erase files on Linux Lite. This method will ensure that even with data recovery software, files will be irretrievable. 1. Open your home folder, go to: Edit, Configure custom actions... 2. Click the + symbol in the top right, and enter the following details as shown in the picture below on the Basic tab: Name: Shred file... Description: Securely erase files permanently Command: shred -u %F (the icon chosen here is emblem-important from All Icons) 3. In the Appearance Conditions tab, select the following: File Pattern: * Click on Ok and Close when finished. Now when you want to permanently and securely erase a file from your computer without the chance of recovery, right click any number of files and select Shred file... Top of page Setting your Language Here's how to set a language system wide following an install of Linux Lite. 1. Click on Menu, Settings, Language Support. 2. You will get a dialog box pop up, click on Remind Me Later. 3. Now click on the button Install / Remove Languages. 4. In this example, we'll install the Portuguese language. Scroll down, find your language and tick the box next to it, then click on Apply. You'll then be prompted for your password. After you've entered your password, your computer will begin to download all the language files, this may take a while. 6. Once that is done, scroll to the bottom of the Language for menus and windows box and drag your newly installed language to the top of the list. Then click on Apply System-Wide, you'll be prompted for your password again. Now wait for the settings to be applied, it will take a few moments. 7. Now click on the Regional Formats tab, select the language you just installed, and click on Apply System-Wide. Enter your password again if prompted to. 8. Now logout and login again and you will see that your new language has been applied. Please note that not all programs may not have your language applied. If this is the case, search for that program in Package Manager and see if there is a language pack available for it. Also note that after you have changed your language, some of the Menu items may not be translated properly. There is little we can do about this, an easy way to rename Menu entries is by going to Menu, Settings, Menu Editor and editing the entries there. Top of page Enabling TRIM on your SSD Trim in Linux Lite Series 5.x and onwards is now a SystemD service that runs automatically weekly. There is no need to set up Trim anymore in Linux Lite. You can get further information regarding Trim in your system by running the following commands in your terminal: Open a terminal and do: Terminal Command: systemctl list-timers -a and: Terminal Command: sudo journalctl -u fstrim.timer Top of page Drives & Partitions Let's familiarize with the terms drive, partitions and volumes. They are commonly used terms and understanding\twhat they are will help you in the process of mounting drives/partitions. The term drive refers to a physical storage device such as a hard disk, solid-state disk, removable USB flash drive etc. In Linux, devices are represented by special file system objects called device nodes, which are visible under the /dev directory. Storage devices are labeled under /dev according to the type of device, followed by a letter signifying the order in which they were detected by the system. In Linux the prefix sd is used for all PATA, SATA and SCSI devices. For instance, the device files /dev/sda, /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc correspond to the first, second and third device (drive) respectively. A physical storage device (drive) can be divided into multiple logical storage units known as partitions. Each partition will show up under /dev as a separate device node. A number after the device letter signifies the number of the partition. For example, the device node files /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 refer to the first and second partition of the first device (drive). Note that on PCs using MBR partitioning, due to the limit of four primary partitions and the way extended partitions are handled the partition numbering can slightly differ from the actual partition count. The term volume in Linux is related to the Logical Volume Manager (LVM), which can be used to manage mass storage devices. A physical volume is a storage device or partition. A logical volume created by the LVM is a logical storage device which can span multiple physical volumes. Top of page Mounting Drives & Partitions Mounting drives and partitions in Linux Lite is easy. While the following approach is generally acceptable, it imposes some limitations in the way a drive can be used in your system. For instance, the drive will remain mounted as long as the computer is not restarted or the drive is not manually unmounted. You will need to mount the drive after each reboot. Also, as administrator, you can read and write to the drive but no other user will be able to write to the drive or read any of its content. Read on Automount Drives & Partitions for all users section for other options. By default, all drives connected to your computer will show up on the Desktop as well as in Thunar File Manager, as long as the drive in question contains at least one partition. As you may have noticed in the screenshot above, the drive shown is grayed-out, meaning that it is not mounted by default. To mount a drive in Linux Lite, double click the desired drive and type the administrator password when prompted to do so. Mounting drives requires administrative privileges. Once mounted, the drive icon reflects just that (not longer grayed-out)... you are now ready to use the drive. Top of page Automount Drives & Partitions for all users A more user-friendly way to mount drives in Linux Lite is to have them automount at startup and allow all users to read and write to the drive. The instructions below shows how to mount a drive in Linux Lite with automount options and read and write permissions for all users. You can follow these steps to mount as many partitions as you may need. Start by creating a folder to assign a mount point path to the drive. Open Terminal and execute: Terminal Command: sudo mkdir /media/disk1 ... where disk1 is the name of the folder we are creating and /media is the directory under which it will be created. Then, open Menu, Settings, Disks. Select the disk you want to make available from the left column, then click on Edit Mount Options as shown below. Set the following mount option: 1- Switch off Automatic Mount Options 2- Check Mount at startup 3- Mount options: users,noexec,nosuid 4- Mount Point: /media/disk1 (the path of the folder you created in the previous step) 5- Identify As: /dev/sdb1 (it may be sdb1, sdb2, sdc1 or similar - select from the drop down menu) 6- Filesystem: ' auto ' or ' ext4 ' (Linux) or ' ntfs ' (Windows) if you want to be explicit. Optionally, you could also set a Display Name for your drive, making it easier to identify. The Display Name will be appended to the mount options(3) as you type it. Click OK to apply your changes and enter your password when prompted to do so. Finally, you can either reboot your computer or manually mount the device so that you don't have to reboot. The configured drive will mount automatically on every reboot from there on. All users will be able to read and write on the drive and no prompt for administrative password will be required. To manually mount the drive, click on Mount selected partition (little triangle in the Volumes actions buttons): The selected drive will then be mounted. Repeat these steps to automount other drives (or additional partitions within a drive) as needed. Top of page Automount Windows Partitions for all users Linux Lite can read and write NTFS file systems on external drives by default. To mount a Windows partition, create a new folder to assign a mount point path for the Windows partition. Open Terminal and execute: Terminal Command: sudo mkdir /media/disk1 ... where disk1 is the name of the folder we are creating and /media is the directory under which it will be created. Make sure to create a new folder for each drive you are mounting in your system. For example, assume you are already using /media/disk1 to automount a different drive or partition, you want to have a different folder to assign a mount point path for the Windows partition then; it can be named anything you want: disk2, disk3, windowsdisk, etc. and make sure to adjust the Mount Point options accordingly in the steps below. Next, open Menu, Settings, Disks, select the disk which contains the Windows partition from the left column, highlight (click) the Windows partition and finally click on Edit Mount Options: Set the following mount option: 1- Switch off Automatic Mount Options 2- Check Mount at startup 3- Mount options: defaults 4- Mount Point: /media/disk1 (the path of the folder you previously created) 5- Identify As: /dev/sdb3 (it may be sdb2, sdb3, sdc2 or similar - select it from the drop down menu) 6- Filesystem: ' auto ' or ' ntfs ' (Windows) if you want to be explicit. Click OK to apply your changes and enter your password when prompted to do so. Finally, you can either reboot your computer or manually mount the device so that you don't have to reboot. The configured drive will mount automatically on every reboot from there on. All users will be able to read and write on the drive and no prompt for administrative password will be required. To manually mount the drive, click on Mount selected partition (little triangle in the Volumes actions buttons): The selected drive will then be mounted. Repeat these steps to automount other drives (or additional partitions within a drive) as needed. Top of page Controlling Access to Mounted Drives Usually, you want to mount drives in Linux Lite and make them available to all users. But there are times when controlling access to those drives becomes a necessity. For example, you may want to automount a Windows drive at startup but prevent other users from modifying the contents in that drive; which is certainly important. Maybe you do not want them to see its content at all. There is a simple (yet effective) way for accomplishing just that at the time of mounting drives and partitions; by using uid, gid and umask. A user ID (uid) is a unique positive integer assigned by Linux operating system to each user. Each user is identified to the system by its uid, and user names are generally used only as an interface for humans. The same is true for gid (group ID) but it references groups instead of users. The user file-mode creation mask (umask) is use to determine the file permission for newly created files. It can be used to control the default file permission. Let's put together some examples on how we could set some restrictions at the time of mounting drives. First, we need to know the uid/gid of the administrative account we are using to mount the drive. In this example, our username is liteuser. Open Terminal and execute: Terminal Command: id -u usernameid -g username ... where username is your administrator account username; liteuser in our case. For umask, we are going to go with the most common options you'll usually need: umask 222 - Assigns permissions so that everyone has read-only access for files and directories, including your account. umask 077 - Assigns permissions so that only you have read/write access for files, and read/write/search for directories you own. All others have no access permissions to your files or directories. umask 022 - Assigns permissions so that only you have read/write access for files, and read/write/search for directories you own. All others have read access only to your files, and read/search access to your directories. umask 002 - Assigns permissions so that only you and members of your group have read/write access to files, and read/write/search access to directories you own. All others have read access only to your files, and read/search to your directories. Using Menu, Settings, Disks, mount a drive with some content in it using your uid, gid and umask=077: With the above mount options, this is what liteuser and user1 accounts get to access. Feel free to experiment with umask options, different groups and users. For additional references, see man mount and man umask. Top of page Adding another User To add another User to Linux Lite, click on Menu, Settings, Lite User Manager. Then click on Add New User and enter a name, and the same password twice. Please note, there is a character limit for both your user and the user you are tying to add of 30 characters. If you get an error adding a user, this could be one of the reasons why. To change your own password via the command line, do:. passwd To change someone else's password via the command line (you must have sudo rights to do this), do:. sudo passwd otherusersnamehere And follow the onscreen instructions. NOTE: Choose a strong password, a mix of upper and lower case as well as a mix of numbers and characters. An example of this would be: y%9L2x#o would be considered a strong password. Use a program like KeePassXC to keep all your passwords safely stored and NEVER use the same password for different websites and accounts. Never compromise your security for convenience. You will then be asked for your password, enter it and click on OK to finish creating the new user account. The new user will have the same rights as the default user (you) except for Administrator rights meaning they will be unable to modify system settings such as installing software and changing system files. User Permissions If you want your new user to have Administrator rights, in the right hand pane scroll down to sudo, place a tick in the box beside it and click on Apply. You can give the new user other group permissions to by using this method, but out of the box this should not be necessary as by default, the application already does all this for you. Now when the new user next logs in, they will have the same full system rights as you. You will both be 'Administrators'. Removing a User NOTE: Before removing a user account make sure their files are backed up to a usb device or the cloud first. Removing an account also removes all that persons documents, pictures, videos, files etc. This is as easy as selecting the user that you want to remove from the Select user drop down box, clicking on Remove selected user and clicking on Apply. If you are asked for your password, please enter it and then click Ok. Next a confirmation box will appear, read the message and if you want to proceed click on Yes. The user account and all their data has now been removed. Top of page Resetting your Password Forgot your password? It happens to all of us at some stage. Fortunately setting it again is fairly straight forward. Lets begin. Boot up your computer and immediately press and hold down the Shift or ESC key. You should see a screen like this. Next press the e key whilst that top line is highlighted. This will take you to the next screen. Use your arrow keys to move down to the line highlighted in the picture below. Use the arrow key until you reach the end of that line. Press the backspace key repeatedly until you remove: ro splash quiet $vt_handoff and replace that text with: rw init=/bin/bash so that it looks like the picture below. Now press either F10 or Ctrl+X to boot your machine to a command prompt. At the prompt, type: passwd jerry where jerry is your username, then press enter. You will be asked to type in a new password twice. Your password has now been changed. Now we are ready to save those changes, then reboot the computer.Type in: sync then hit enter. Then type in: reboot -f Your computer will reboot. If you see the screen shown below again, just hit enter. This is normal and won't appear the next time you reboot your computer. You may also not see the boot animation on this boot, this to is normal and will reappear next time you boot up. Now login with your password. Top of page Terminal Basics Linux Lite is designed to be such that new users won't have to venture into the terminal to much. But, there will be some occasions where we need to run the odd terminal command. The following is a very basic introduction to some of the more common terminal commands that will help you to navigate around your computer, should you need to. TIP: instead of typing out the entire name of a file or folder, type the first few letters and hit your TAB key, this will auto complete the name. This will save you lots of time but be careful and make sure you have typed the correct file name. In the examples below 'directory' also means 'folder'. When you first open a terminal, your location in the file system will be your home directory. You can confirm that by using the first command listed below, \"pwd\". It will show that you are in \"/home/username\", where \"username\" is your actual username. pwd - shows you the present working directory (the directory you are currently in). If you get lost, just type \"pwd\" and it will tell you where you are in the file system. ls - display a list of files and directories in the current directory ls -la - a more comprehensive listing that displays file properties in the current directory, including hidden files and their properties. cd - change directory, change to another directory. For instance, if you are currently located at /home/username and want to go to your Documents folder, type: cd Documents. If you then type pwd, you will see that your location is now /home/username/Documents. No matter where you are in the terminal typing just cd will return you to your home folder in the terminal. cd .. - go back one directory (up to the parent directory of your current location). cp - copy file to another directory rm - remove a file or directory rm -rf - permanently delete a file or directory mv - rename a file or directory. You can also use it to move a file from one location to another eg. mv /home/jerry/file1.doc /home/jerry/Documents cat - display the contents inside a file mkdir - make a new folder rmdir - remove a folder killall - kill a program with that name man - read the manual for a particular program (type q to exit the manual) CopyLeft Linux Command Reference: Top of page Adding another User Enabling TRIM on your SSD Installation Guide Installing Linux Lite to your computer - UEFI Mode Installing Linux Lite to your computer - Legacy BIOS Mode Drives & Partitions - Mounting Drives & Partitions - Automount Drives & Partitions for all users - Automount Windows Partitions for all users - Controlling Access to Mounted Drives - Advanced Users No USB Boot option in the BIOS?

To create a bootable DVD, you need to burn the ISO as an \"image\" to the DVD. Below are listed three free Windows programs that will enable you to do that. If burning to a USB stick, we have also listed a free program that we recommend for doing that in Windows; or a reliable method to create a bootable USB when using a Linux system, or OSX. Once you have your bootable media created, you may need to access your computer's BIOS settings to set the boot order for booting CD/DVD/USB's first (before the hard drive). Typically there will be one or two special keys that can be pressed during initial power-up of the computer (before an operating system starts booting) that will allow you access to either the BIOS Settings/Startup Menu or a separate Boot Menu. Specific keys vary from one manufacturer to the next, so refer to your user manual if you are not sure how to access the settings. Writing the Linux Lite ISO to a USB on Windows A good, simple point and click USB ISO burner is Etcher or Rufus. Links - Etcher Home Page, Rufus Home Page. Guide: - Insert a 4Gb or larger USB stick into your PC. You MUST format the entire USB drive to Fat32 before proceeding. - Install, then start Etcher or Rufus. - Select the Linux Lite ISO file from Etcher or Rufus and write the image to your USB. These instructions are generic for Windows (Rufus is Windows only), Linux and Mac OS. Writing the Linux Lite ISO to a DVD on Windows Here is some free DVD burning software for you to select from: BurnAware Free - http://www.burnaware.com CDBurnerXP - http://cdburnerxp.se/ ImgBurn - http://www.imgburn.com/ Place a blank DVD in your DVD drive, open up the program, select the ISO file that you want to burn. Choose the lowest burn speed, this will greatly reduce the risk of your burn becoming corrupt as can sometimes happen. A 4x or 6x speed is recommended if you have it. The lower the burn speed, the better. Writing the Linux Lite ISO to USB on Linux (see above, the process is similar) Etcher allows you to create a bootable Live USB drive. You will need a 4Gb or larger USB drive. Download Etcher from here. Writing the Linux Lite ISO to USB in Linux and OSX (see above, the process is similar) Using a GUI application You can use Etcher as mentioned above to write the Linux Lite ISO image to a USB. You will need a 4Gb or larger USB drive. Etcher works on - Windows, Mac & Linux. Download it from here. Using a Terminal To find out the letter of your USB stick, open a terminal and type: df -h It is usually listed as /media/yourusername/ or similar. Be very careful to make sure you choose the right drive letter, as you can see in the Filesystem column, my device is /dev/sda1 another clue is the value in the Size column, here it is shown as 7.6G. In this example my device is listed as: /media/jerry/STUFF in the Mounted on column. Open a folder and make sure you are in the directory that the iso file is in. Open a terminal in that directory and type the following: Terminal Command: sudo dd if=linux-lite-6.6-64bit.iso of=/dev/sdx bs=4M Change the x in sdx to match the letter of your USB device. In the above example, my device is shown as sda1 (leave out the '1') Example Terminal Command: sudo dd if=linux-lite-6.6-64bit.iso of=/dev/sda bs=4M The Live DVD/USB image will boot into the desktop automatically, there is no need to login manually. No USB Boot option in the BIOS? Use PloP For full instructions click here. Preparing your Computer for the Installation If you are planning to have Linux Lite as the sole operating system on your computer, there is nothing special you need to do in preparation for the installation, even if another operating system is currently occupying the hard drive. Simply boot up your live installation disk, give Linux Lite a test run if you'd like, then start the installation by double-clicking the Install Linux Lite icon on the desktop. When you get to the Installation Type screen, tell the installer to use the whole disk and it will go ahead and erase anything that is already there, create the partitions needed, format them and install the system automatically. If you currently have one physical hard drive and want to dual-boot Windows and Linux Lite, then you should do a few things to prepare for the installation to insure the best results. Create backup copies of any important data files. (You probably won't need them - but if you do, you'll be glad you made the backups.) Create Windows recovery disk(s) if you haven't already done so before. Defragment your largest Windows partition (likely the \"C: drive\"). If Windows partitions currently span the entire hard drive, one (or more) of its partitions will need to be shrunk down to make room for the Linux installation. Shrink the Windows partition from within Windows disk management. (You can shrink the partition during the installation, but it is probably best to use Windows to shrink Windows partitions.) If you defragmented and shrunk the Windows partition ahead of time, leave the resulting space as unpartitioned, unused, free space. DO NOT create any new partitions from within Windows for the Linux Lite installation. (If you are familiar with partitioning and want to create the partitions ahead of time, use GParted for doing that while booted in the live Linux Lite DVD/USB.) If you plan to have the shrinking done by the installer, it is still recommended that you defragment the Windows partition ahead of time. If you have more than one physical hard drive and want to dual-boot Windows and Linux Lite, with Linux Lite on its own dedicated physical drive, then we recommend you make a request for guidance in our Forum if you are unfamiliar with Linux based installations. Otherwise, general instructions for such an installation are listed below. Choose \"Something else\" on the \"Installation Type\" screen during installation. (See instructions in following section for pictures of installation stages.) On the following page, choose the specific drive that you want for Linux Lite. Create your partitions, choose appropriate file system types, and designate mount points. Near bottom of the window, select a drive for the boot loader installation. (That will be something like /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, etc. - without a partition # after it. Not /dev/sda1, for instance.) It will be pre-filled for the MBR of the first hard drive. If Windows is on the first drive, it's boot loader will be replaced with the Linux boot loader (grub2) unless you specify a different drive. That is fine, but an alternative is to install the boot loader to the Linux hard drive, then set the BIOS to boot from that drive. That will preserve the Windows boot loader on its own drive. Once installation is complete, reboot and the Linux boot loader will have automatically detected your Windows installation and added it to the boot menu choices. Top of page Installing Linux Lite to your computer - UEFI Mode Start your computer, and go into your system BIOS and check that the boot order is set so that DVD and USB devices are set to boot first. This varies from BIOS to BIOS. Refer to your motherboard documentation for more information. You are advised to disable Secure Boot and make sure UEFI is set to Enabled in your BIOS. See here for more information before proceeding if you need any more clarification. Once you are happy with your BIOS set up, insert the DVD disc or USB stick into your computer and reboot your computer. You'll be greeted with the following screen. Let the timer run down if you want to boot to the Live session. Make sure Boot Linux Lite 6.6 Live System is highlighted, press the enter key to boot the Live session. This is also a good way to check that all of your hardware is supported. The other options are: Boot Linux Lite 6.6 Live System - boot directly into the Linux Lite Desktop. Direct install Linux Lite 6.6 - install Linux Lite immediately without booting to the Desktop. Compatibility Mode Linux Lite 6.6 - use this option if you're having trouble with the first 2 options. Check for file system corruption - checks the install image for errors, if none are found, it will boot into the Desktop as per usual. Reboot - restart off your computer. Shutdown - turn off your computer. Some of these boot options may or may not appear as they do in the image above. The types of options varies from release to release. NOTE: If you are having any trouble booting Linux Lite after installation, please read through this trouble shooting guide. The computer will go through the boot up process, this may take anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes depending on your hardware. There will also be a compulsory file check, this is checking all of the files on the DVD or USB to ensure they meet file integrity. It is advised not to skip this procedure. The login for the Live user is automatic, there is no need to login. If for some reason you need to login, simply type in linux beneath Other and click on Log In (no password required). Before we proceed, make sure you have an internet connection first. Click here if you need help to get online before you install Linux Lite. Once you've had a look around Linux Lite and are ready to install the first step is to double click on the Install Linux Lite icon on your Desktop. The installer will then open on the desktop and display the first window of the installer. From here you will select your preferred language and view release notes (option not always available) for this version of Linux Lite. Keyboard layout The next step is to select your keyboard language and layout. You may select the language that your keyboard corresponds to on the left and any specialized layout on the right. This is the point where you may select to enable international keys on your keyboard. Though, these options may be changed later. For a faster install, we recommend you leave the default English (US) options here, and adjust your language settings once Linux Lite has been installed and you have rebooted for the first time. Updates and other software After selecting continue, you are presented with some requirements for the installation. Ensure that these requirements are met by viewing a check mark beside them. You may also choose to download any available updates while installing or install third-party software during the installation. NOTE: 'Download updates while installing Linux' Generally we don't recommend ticking it as this will significantly slow down the install process. Updating after a fresh install is recommended and will save you time in the long run. A typical install on today's hardware will take around 10-15 minutes. If you check these 2 boxes, the install could take over an hour or longer. NOTE: 'Install third-party software for graphics and Wi-Fi hardware and additional media formats' Please verify the legal status of the use of the third party software in your country/territory before choosing this option. This option will install codecs for playing media files, and proprietary drivers for some of your hardware. It is a legal requirement for us to inform you of this. Installation type Now it is time to choose the method of installing Linux Lite to your hard disk. You will have several options during this phase of the installer. Erase Disk and Install Linux NOTE: This option will erase your entire hard drive. Make sure this is what you want to do before proceeding. Upon selecting Erase Disk, the installer will automatically select the default partitioning scheme. Click on Install Now to accept the changes. NOTE: This installation option will automatically install the Linux bootloader to the first hard drive on the system. That is typically how most people install and the Linux boot loader offers the choice of booting any other operating systems that are on your computer. However, if your intent is to keep the Windows boot loader in charge of booting the Windows drive and the Windows drive is the first one, then you need to use the 'Something else' installation type. That way you can control the 'Device for boot loader installation' and set it for the specific drive you choose for Linux Lite. Advanced features There are 2 options in here. Use LVM with the new Linux installation and EXPERIMENTAL: Erase disk and use ZFS. ZFS is an advanced filesystem usually found in Servers. Unless you are familiar with ZFS, there is absolutely no need to use it, doing so could corrupt your system if you don't know what you are doing. NOTE: If you choose the Use LVM with the new Linux installation you will be prompted to enter a strong password. This will option will encrypt your entire Linux Lite install. Encrypting is optional and only recommended for people who understand the encryption process. Selecting Erase disk and install Linux will automatically partition your hard drive as shown below. Something else (dual booting or custom partitioning) Select Something else from this screen if you wish to dual boot with Windows or edit existing partitions (or both). Keeping Windows (dual booting) When manual partitioning, set 500mb of space on sda1 as a EFI System Partition (No Windows operating system installed). If you are dual-booting, create a separate partition, do not use sda1. In this example, we have 3 partitions. sda1 - The recovery partition for Windows. sda2 - Where Windows is installed (note ntfs is the Type). sda3 - The spare, unformatted partition. This is where we will install Linux Lite to. Click on the sda3 partition and click the Change button. Select Ext4 journaling file system, place a tick in Format the partition and select / as the Mount point. Click OK. NOTE: If you have any other NTFS drives, it is important to give these a mount point during the install. That way they will be easily accessible after the installation. The mount point is simply \"where\" in the file system you want that partition's files to show up. You can name the mount point what ever you want, be sure to give it a simple, no spaces lowercase name like eg. /myntfs do not use /My NTFS. DO NOT select 'Format the partition' when editing any NTFS partitions. NOTE: If you are manual partitioning here, make sure in the 'Device for boot loader installation:' drop down, you select /dev/sda. Grub must be installed here to the root sda device or you will have trouble booting. This is the case for ALL partitioning options. When you have finished, click on Install Now. Overwriting Windows In this example, we select the sda2 partition (where Windows is installed) and click the Change button. Select Ext4 journaling file system, place a tick in Format the partition and select / as the Mount point. Click OK. NOTE: Device for boot loader installation. The Linux boot loader offers the choice of booting any other operating systems that are on your computer. In this example since we are over writing Windows, we simply select sda for the boot loader. Whichever method you choose, once you are finished, click on Install Now. Where are you? After completing the partitioning phase of the installation, you are prompted to set up some personal details about the system. The installer will continue to work in the background while you are filling out this information. The first step is to select your time zone. The installer may detect your time zone based on your location via your ISP's information. If not, you may select your time zone by either clicking on your region on the supplied map or by typing in your area in the box below. Who are you? On the next screen, you are greeted by several fields to fill. These fields include: Your name - your real, full name. Your computer's name - the name that you wish to use to identify the computer on your network. Pick a username - your user name that is used to login to the system. Choose a password - your password that you wish to use for your user and sudo (administrator) password. Confirm your password - enter the above password again. NOTE: Choose a strong password, a mix of upper and lower case as well as a mix of numbers and characters. An example of this would be: y%9L2x#o would be considered a strong password. Use a program like KeePassXC to keep all your passwords safely stored and NEVER use the same password for different websites. (KeePassXC is available for installation from Menu, Settings, Lite Software. You do not need to download it from their website.) NEVER COMPROMISE YOUR SECURITY FOR CONVENIENCE. There are also options to enable auto-login for your user or have the computer prompt you for a password everytime you login. If you have a webcam, you may encounter a screen during the install asking to Take a photo this feature is supported so that when you first log in, your photo will be displayed as your avatar. If you skip this step, you can use a .png photo of yourself, rename it to .face and place it in your /home/user folder. By default, the Linux Lite logo will represent your login icon. After finishing all of these steps you will be greeted with a slideshow detailing all of the features and software that are included in this version of Linux Lite. You may allow them to play on their own or navigate through them using the arrow buttons on the sides of the window (the picture below may vary from version to version). Once the installation is complete you will be prompted to either restart your computer and begin using your newly installed Linux Lite system or to continue using the testing environment on the DVD/USB that you are using. If for some reason your computer hangs on restart, press F4 or Enter. After a reboot you will be greeted by the login screen: After you have logged in you will see the desktop and Welcome window. Be sure to read through the Welcome window to get you off to the best possible start to using Linux Lite. Install Updates - do this first (reboot if prompted to after updates have finished). Install Drivers - see if there are any drivers needed for your computer. Set a Restore Point - set your first restore point using Timeshift, similar to System Restore in Windows. Install Language Support - if you are using anything other than English. Select Dark or Light Theme - self explanatory. Installing Linux Lite to your computer - Legacy BIOS Mode Once you are happy with your BIOS set up, insert the DVD disc or USB stick into your computer and reboot your computer. You'll be greeted with the following screen. Let the timer run down if you want to boot to the Live session. Make sure Boot Linux Lite 6.6 Live System is highlighted, press the enter key to boot the Live session. This is also a good way to check that all of your hardware is supported. If you are having trouble booting and you get just a black screen, try the second option, Compatibility Mode Linux Lite 6.6. The other options are: Boot Linux Lite 6.6 Live System - boot directly into the Linux Lite Desktop. Direct install Linux Lite 6.6 - install Linux Lite immediately without booting to the Desktop. Compatibility Mode Linux Lite 6.6 - use this option if you're having trouble with the first 2 options. Check for file system corruption - checks the install image for errors, if none are found, it will boot into the Desktop as per usual. Reboot - restart off your computer. Shutdown - turn off your computer. Some of these boot options may or may not appear as they do in the image above. The number of options changes from release to release. NOTE: If you are having any trouble booting Linux Lite after installation, please read through this trouble shooting guide. The computer will go through the boot up process, this may take anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes depending on your hardware. There will also be a compulsory file check, this is checking all of the files on the DVD or USB to ensure they meet file integrity. It is advised not to skip this procedure. The login for the Live user is automatic, there is no need to login. If for some reason you need to login, simply type in linux beneath Other and click on Log In (no password required). Before we proceed, make sure you have an internet connection first. Click here if you need help to get online before you install Linux Lite. Once you've had a look around Linux Lite and are ready to install the first step is to double click on the Install Linux Lite icon on your Desktop. The installer will then open on the desktop and display the first window of the installer. From here you will select your preferred language and view release notes for this version of Linux Lite. Keyboard layout The next step is to select your keyboard language and layout. You may select the language that your keyboard corresponds to on the left and any specialized layout on the right. This is the point where you may select to enable international keys on your keyboard. Though, these options may be changed later. For a faster install, we recommend you leave the default English (US) options here, and adjust your language settings once Linux Lite has been installed and you have rebooted for the first time. Updates and other software After selecting continue, you are presented with some requirements for the installation. Ensure that these requirements are met by viewing a check mark beside them. You may also choose to download any available updates while installing or install third-party software during the installation. NOTE: 'Download updates while installing Linux' Generally we don't recommend ticking it as this will significantly slow down the install process. Updating after a fresh install is recommended and will save you time in the long run. A typical install on today's hardware will take around 10-15 minutes. If you check these 2 boxes, the install could take over an hour or longer. NOTE: 'Install third-party software for graphics and Wi-Fi hardware and additional media formats' Please verify the legal status of the use of the third party software in your country/territory before choosing this option. This option will install codecs for playing media files, and proprietary drivers for some of your hardware. It is a legal requirement for us to inform you of this. Installation type Now it is time to choose the method of installing Linux Lite to your hard disk. You will have several options during this phase of the installer. Erase Disk and Install Linux NOTE: This option will erase your entire hard drive. Make sure this is what you want to do before proceeding. Upon selecting Erase Disk, the installer will automatically select the default partitioning scheme. Click on Install Now to accept the changes. NOTE: This installation option will automatically install the Linux bootloader to the first hard drive on the system. That is typically how most people install and the Linux boot loader offers the choice of booting any other operating systems that are on your computer. However, if your intent is to keep the Windows boot loader in charge of booting the Windows drive and the Windows drive is the first one, then you need to use the 'Something else' installation type. That way you can control the 'Device for boot loader installation' and set it for the specific drive you choose for Linux Lite. Advanced features There are 2 options in here. Use LVM with the new Linux installation and EXPERIMENTAL: Erase disk and use ZFS. ZFS is an advanced filesystem usually found in Servers. Unless you are familiar with ZFS, there is absolutely no need to use it, doing so could corrupt your system if you don't know what you are doing. NOTE: If you choose the Use LVM with the new Linux installation you will be prompted to enter a strong password. This will option will encrypt your entire Linux Lite install. Encrypting is optional and only recommended for people who understand the encryption process. Something else (dual booting or custom partitioning) Select Something else from this screen if you wish to dual boot with Windows or edit existing partitions (or both). Keeping Windows (dual booting) In this example, we have 3 partitions. sda1 - The recovery partition for Windows. sda2 - Where Windows is installed (note ntfs is the Type). sda3 - The spare, unformatted partition. This is where we will install Linux Lite to. NOTE: If you have any other NTFS drives, it is important to give these a mount point during the install. That way they will be easily accessible after the installation. The mount point is simply \"where\" in the file system you want that partition's files to show up. You can name the mount point what ever you want, be sure to give it a simple, no spaces lowercase name like eg. /myntfs do not use /My NTFS. DO NOT select 'Format the partition' when editing any NTFS partitions. Click on the sda3 partition and click the Change button. Select Ext4 journaling file system, place a tick in Format the partition and select / as the Mount point. Click OK. When you have finished, click on Install Now. Overwriting Windows In this example, we select the sda2 partition (where Windows is installed) and click the Change button. Select Ext4 journaling file system, place a tick in Format the partition and select / as the Mount point. Click OK. NOTE: Device for boot loader installation. The Linux boot loader offers the choice of booting any other operating systems that are on your computer. In this example since we are over writing Windows, we simply select sda for the boot loader. Whichever method you choose, once you are finished, click on Install Now. Where are you? After completing the partitioning phase of the installation, you are prompted to set up some personal details about the system. The installer will continue to work in the background while you are filling out this information. The first step is to select your time zone. The installer may detect your time zone based on your location via your ISP's information. If not, you may select your time zone by either clicking on your region on the supplied map or by typing in your area in the box below. Who are you? On the next screen, you are greeted by several fields to fill. These fields include: Your name - your real, full name. Your computer's name - the name that you wish to use to identify the computer on your network. Pick a username - your user name that is used to login to the system. Choose a password - your password that you wish to use for your user and sudo (administrator) password. Confirm your password - enter the above password again. NOTE: Choose a strong password, a mix of upper and lower case as well as a mix of numbers and characters. An example of this would be: y%9L2x#o would be considered a strong password. Use a program like KeePassXC to keep all your passwords safely stored and NEVER use the same password for different websites. (KeePassXC is available for installation from Menu, Settings, Lite Software. You do not need to download it from their website.) NEVER COMPROMISE YOUR SECURITY FOR CONVENIENCE. There are also options to enable auto-login for your user or have the computer prompt you for a password everytime you login. If you have a webcam, you may encounter a screen during the install asking to Take a photo this feature is supported so that when you first log in, your photo will be displayed as your avatar. If you skip this step, you can use a .png photo of yourself, rename it to .face and place it in your /home/user folder. By default, the Linux Lite logo will represent your login icon. After finishing all of these steps you will be greeted with a slideshow detailing all of the features and software that are included in this version of Linux Lite. You may allow them to play on their own or navigate through them using the arrow buttons on the sides of the window (the picture below may vary from version to version). Once the installation is complete you will be prompted to either restart your computer and begin using your newly installed Linux Lite system or to continue using the testing environment on the DVD/USB that you are using. If for some reason your computer hangs on restart, press F4 or Enter. NOTE: There will be no prompt to remove your DVD or USB after installation so remember to remove your DVD or USB as soon as your pc reboots. After a reboot you will be greeted by the login screen: After you have logged in you will see the desktop and Welcome window. Be sure to read through the Welcome window to get you off to the best possible start to using Linux Lite. Install Updates - do this first (reboot if prompted to after updates have finished). Install Drivers - see if there are any drivers needed for your computer. Set a Restore Point - set your first restore point using Timeshift, similar to System Restore in Windows. Install Language Support - if you are using anything other than English. Select Dark or Light Theme - self explanatory. OEM Install (not in Series 6x) NOTE: You MUST use an Ethernet connection for this process, do not use WiFi. NOTE: These instructions have been left here as a reference for previous Series of Linux Lite where the OEM install option is still available. Some of the wording and screenshots information may differ. Choose - OEM install Linux Lite 6.6 (for manufacturers) from the Boot menu. Wait for the filesystem check to complete. Boot menu: Select your Language, then in the box enter in your computer distribution/company name. Here we will use ACME as our company name. On the next screen, choose your keyboard. Check Download updates while installing Linux. Check Erase disk and install Linux, then click in Install Now. Select your Region. You only need to enter a password on this next box. This password is temporary and is used by the OEM later on. The install will now complete. Eject the install media, and reboot. As the OEM, click on Menu, Accessories, Prepare for Shipping or use the shortcut on the Desktop as shown below. Enter the password you created during the previous install process. The following box will pop up when the process has finished. Click OK, shutdown the machine and prepare your computer for shipping/delivery. Customer Turn on your computer and wait for it to start up. Once it has started, select your language. Click on Continue. Select your Keyboard layout. Select your Region. Enter your details, including a good, strong password. The system will now complete the installation process. If you see some Ubuntu branded slides, just ignore them. Linux Lite is based off Ubuntu and from time to time there may be some mixed branding. You can now log into your computer and start using it. Top of page Securely Erasing files Permanently The following tutorial explains how to set up and securely erase files on Linux Lite. This method will ensure that even with data recovery software, files will be irretrievable. 1. Open your home folder, go to: Edit, Configure custom actions... 2. Click the + symbol in the top right, and enter the following details as shown in the picture below on the Basic tab: Name: Shred file... Description: Securely erase files permanently Command: shred -u %F (the icon chosen here is emblem-important from All Icons) 3. In the Appearance Conditions tab, select the following: File Pattern: * Click on Ok and Close when finished. Now when you want to permanently and securely erase a file from your computer without the chance of recovery, right click any number of files and select Shred file... Top of page Setting your Language Here's how to set a language system wide following an install of Linux Lite. 1. Click on Menu, Settings, Language Support. 2. You will get a dialog box pop up, click on Remind Me Later. 3. Now click on the button Install / Remove Languages. 4. In this example, we'll install the Portuguese language. Scroll down, find your language and tick the box next to it, then click on Apply. You'll then be prompted for your password. After you've entered your password, your computer will begin to download all the language files, this may take a while. 6. Once that is done, scroll to the bottom of the Language for menus and windows box and drag your newly installed language to the top of the list. Then click on Apply System-Wide, you'll be prompted for your password again. Now wait for the settings to be applied, it will take a few moments. 7. Now click on the Regional Formats tab, select the language you just installed, and click on Apply System-Wide. Enter your password again if prompted to. 8. Now logout and login again and you will see that your new language has been applied. Please note that not all programs may not have your language applied. If this is the case, search for that program in Package Manager and see if there is a language pack available for it. Also note that after you have changed your language, some of the Menu items may not be translated properly. There is little we can do about this, an easy way to rename Menu entries is by going to Menu, Settings, Menu Editor and editing the entries there. Top of page Enabling TRIM on your SSD Trim in Linux Lite Series 5.x and onwards is now a SystemD service that runs automatically weekly. There is no need to set up Trim anymore in Linux Lite. You can get further information regarding Trim in your system by running the following commands in your terminal: Open a terminal and do: Terminal Command: systemctl list-timers -a and: Terminal Command: sudo journalctl -u fstrim.timer Top of page Drives & Partitions Let's familiarize with the terms drive, partitions and volumes. They are commonly used terms and understanding\twhat they are will help you in the process of mounting drives/partitions. The term drive refers to a physical storage device such as a hard disk, solid-state disk, removable USB flash drive etc. In Linux, devices are represented by special file system objects called device nodes, which are visible under the /dev directory. Storage devices are labeled under /dev according to the type of device, followed by a letter signifying the order in which they were detected by the system. In Linux the prefix sd is used for all PATA, SATA and SCSI devices. For instance, the device files /dev/sda, /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc correspond to the first, second and third device (drive) respectively. A physical storage device (drive) can be divided into multiple logical storage units known as partitions. Each partition will show up under /dev as a separate device node. A number after the device letter signifies the number of the partition. For example, the device node files /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 refer to the first and second partition of the first device (drive). Note that on PCs using MBR partitioning, due to the limit of four primary partitions and the way extended partitions are handled the partition numbering can slightly differ from the actual partition count. The term volume in Linux is related to the Logical Volume Manager (LVM), which can be used to manage mass storage devices. A physical volume is a storage device or partition. A logical volume created by the LVM is a logical storage device which can span multiple physical volumes. Top of page Mounting Drives & Partitions Mounting drives and partitions in Linux Lite is easy. While the following approach is generally acceptable, it imposes some limitations in the way a drive can be used in your system. For instance, the drive will remain mounted as long as the computer is not restarted or the drive is not manually unmounted. You will need to mount the drive after each reboot. Also, as administrator, you can read and write to the drive but no other user will be able to write to the drive or read any of its content. Read on Automount Drives & Partitions for all users section for other options. By default, all drives connected to your computer will show up on the Desktop as well as in Thunar File Manager, as long as the drive in question contains at least one partition. As you may have noticed in the screenshot above, the drive shown is grayed-out, meaning that it is not mounted by default. To mount a drive in Linux Lite, double click the desired drive and type the administrator password when prompted to do so. Mounting drives requires administrative privileges. Once mounted, the drive icon reflects just that (not longer grayed-out)... you are now ready to use the drive. Top of page Automount Drives & Partitions for all users A more user-friendly way to mount drives in Linux Lite is to have them automount at startup and allow all users to read and write to the drive. The instructions below shows how to mount a drive in Linux Lite with automount options and read and write permissions for all users. You can follow these steps to mount as many partitions as you may need. Start by creating a folder to assign a mount point path to the drive. Open Terminal and execute: Terminal Command: sudo mkdir /media/disk1 ... where disk1 is the name of the folder we are creating and /media is the directory under which it will be created. Then, open Menu, Settings, Disks. Select the disk you want to make available from the left column, then click on Edit Mount Options as shown below. Set the following mount option: 1- Switch off Automatic Mount Options 2- Check Mount at startup 3- Mount options: users,noexec,nosuid 4- Mount Point: /media/disk1 (the path of the folder you created in the previous step) 5- Identify As: /dev/sdb1 (it may be sdb1, sdb2, sdc1 or similar - select from the drop down menu) 6- Filesystem: ' auto ' or ' ext4 ' (Linux) or ' ntfs ' (Windows) if you want to be explicit. Optionally, you could also set a Display Name for your drive, making it easier to identify. The Display Name will be appended to the mount options(3) as you type it. Click OK to apply your changes and enter your password when prompted to do so. Finally, you can either reboot your computer or manually mount the device so that you don't have to reboot. The configured drive will mount automatically on every reboot from there on. All users will be able to read and write on the drive and no prompt for administrative password will be required. To manually mount the drive, click on Mount selected partition (little triangle in the Volumes actions buttons): The selected drive will then be mounted. Repeat these steps to automount other drives (or additional partitions within a drive) as needed. Top of page Automount Windows Partitions for all users Linux Lite can read and write NTFS file systems on external drives by default. To mount a Windows partition, create a new folder to assign a mount point path for the Windows partition. Open Terminal and execute: Terminal Command: sudo mkdir /media/disk1 ... where disk1 is the name of the folder we are creating and /media is the directory under which it will be created. Make sure to create a new folder for each drive you are mounting in your system. For example, assume you are already using /media/disk1 to automount a different drive or partition, you want to have a different folder to assign a mount point path for the Windows partition then; it can be named anything you want: disk2, disk3, windowsdisk, etc. and make sure to adjust the Mount Point options accordingly in the steps below. Next, open Menu, Settings, Disks, select the disk which contains the Windows partition from the left column, highlight (click) the Windows partition and finally click on Edit Mount Options: Set the following mount option: 1- Switch off Automatic Mount Options 2- Check Mount at startup 3- Mount options: defaults 4- Mount Point: /media/disk1 (the path of the folder you previously created) 5- Identify As: /dev/sdb3 (it may be sdb2, sdb3, sdc2 or similar - select it from the drop down menu) 6- Filesystem: ' auto ' or ' ntfs ' (Windows) if you want to be explicit. Click OK to apply your changes and enter your password when prompted to do so. Finally, you can either reboot your computer or manually mount the device so that you don't have to reboot. The configured drive will mount automatically on every reboot from there on. All users will be able to read and write on the drive and no prompt for administrative password will be required. To manually mount the drive, click on Mount selected partition (little triangle in the Volumes actions buttons): The selected drive will then be mounted. Repeat these steps to automount other drives (or additional partitions within a drive) as needed. Top of page Controlling Access to Mounted Drives Usually, you want to mount drives in Linux Lite and make them available to all users. But there are times when controlling access to those drives becomes a necessity. For example, you may want to automount a Windows drive at startup but prevent other users from modifying the contents in that drive; which is certainly important. Maybe you do not want them to see its content at all. There is a simple (yet effective) way for accomplishing just that at the time of mounting drives and partitions; by using uid, gid and umask. A user ID (uid) is a unique positive integer assigned by Linux operating system to each user. Each user is identified to the system by its uid, and user names are generally used only as an interface for humans. The same is true for gid (group ID) but it references groups instead of users. The user file-mode creation mask (umask) is use to determine the file permission for newly created files. It can be used to control the default file permission. Let's put together some examples on how we could set some restrictions at the time of mounting drives. First, we need to know the uid/gid of the administrative account we are using to mount the drive. In this example, our username is liteuser. Open Terminal and execute: Terminal Command: id -u usernameid -g username ... where username is your administrator account username; liteuser in our case. For umask, we are going to go with the most common options you'll usually need: umask 222 - Assigns permissions so that everyone has read-only access for files and directories, including your account. umask 077 - Assigns permissions so that only you have read/write access for files, and read/write/search for directories you own. All others have no access permissions to your files or directories. umask 022 - Assigns permissions so that only you have read/write access for files, and read/write/search for directories you own. All others have read access only to your files, and read/search access to your directories. umask 002 - Assigns permissions so that only you and members of your group have read/write access to files, and read/write/search access to directories you own. All others have read access only to your files, and read/search to your directories. Using Menu, Settings, Disks, mount a drive with some content in it using your uid, gid and umask=077: With the above mount options, this is what liteuser and user1 accounts get to access. Feel free to experiment with umask options, different groups and users. For additional references, see man mount and man umask. Top of page Adding another User To add another User to Linux Lite, click on Menu, Settings, Lite User Manager. Then click on Add New User and enter a name, and the same password twice. Please note, there is a character limit for both your user and the user you are tying to add of 30 characters. If you get an error adding a user, this could be one of the reasons why. To change your own password via the command line, do:. passwd To change someone else's password via the command line (you must have sudo rights to do this), do:. sudo passwd otherusersnamehere And follow the onscreen instructions. NOTE: Choose a strong password, a mix of upper and lower case as well as a mix of numbers and characters. An example of this would be: y%9L2x#o would be considered a strong password. Use a program like KeePassXC to keep all your passwords safely stored and NEVER use the same password for different websites and accounts. Never compromise your security for convenience. You will then be asked for your password, enter it and click on OK to finish creating the new user account. The new user will have the same rights as the default user (you) except for Administrator rights meaning they will be unable to modify system settings such as installing software and changing system files. User Permissions If you want your new user to have Administrator rights, in the right hand pane scroll down to sudo, place a tick in the box beside it and click on Apply. You can give the new user other group permissions to by using this method, but out of the box this should not be necessary as by default, the application already does all this for you. Now when the new user next logs in, they will have the same full system rights as you. You will both be 'Administrators'. Removing a User NOTE: Before removing a user account make sure their files are backed up to a usb device or the cloud first. Removing an account also removes all that persons documents, pictures, videos, files etc. This is as easy as selecting the user that you want to remove from the Select user drop down box, clicking on Remove selected user and clicking on Apply. If you are asked for your password, please enter it and then click Ok. Next a confirmation box will appear, read the message and if you want to proceed click on Yes. The user account and all their data has now been removed. Top of page Resetting your Password Forgot your password? It happens to all of us at some stage. Fortunately setting it again is fairly straight forward. Lets begin. Boot up your computer and immediately press and hold down the Shift or ESC key. You should see a screen like this. Next press the e key whilst that top line is highlighted. This will take you to the next screen. Use your arrow keys to move down to the line highlighted in the picture below. Use the arrow key until you reach the end of that line. Press the backspace key repeatedly until you remove: ro splash quiet $vt_handoff and replace that text with: rw init=/bin/bash so that it looks like the picture below. Now press either F10 or Ctrl+X to boot your machine to a command prompt. At the prompt, type: passwd jerry where jerry is your username, then press enter. You will be asked to type in a new password twice. Your password has now been changed. Now we are ready to save those changes, then reboot the computer.Type in: sync then hit enter. Then type in: reboot -f Your computer will reboot. If you see the screen shown below again, just hit enter. This is normal and won't appear the next time you reboot your computer. You may also not see the boot animation on this boot, this to is normal and will reappear next time you boot up. Now login with your password. Top of page Terminal Basics Linux Lite is designed to be such that new users won't have to venture into the terminal to much. But, there will be some occasions where we need to run the odd terminal command. The following is a very basic introduction to some of the more common terminal commands that will help you to navigate around your computer, should you need to. TIP: instead of typing out the entire name of a file or folder, type the first few letters and hit your TAB key, this will auto complete the name. This will save you lots of time but be careful and make sure you have typed the correct file name. In the examples below 'directory' also means 'folder'. When you first open a terminal, your location in the file system will be your home directory. You can confirm that by using the first command listed below, \"pwd\". It will show that you are in \"/home/username\", where \"username\" is your actual username. pwd - shows you the present working directory (the directory you are currently in). If you get lost, just type \"pwd\" and it will tell you where you are in the file system. ls - display a list of files and directories in the current directory ls -la - a more comprehensive listing that displays file properties in the current directory, including hidden files and their properties. cd - change directory, change to another directory. For instance, if you are currently located at /home/username and want to go to your Documents folder, type: cd Documents. If you then type pwd, you will see that your location is now /home/username/Documents. No matter where you are in the terminal typing just cd will return you to your home folder in the terminal. cd .. - go back one directory (up to the parent directory of your current location). cp - copy file to another directory rm - remove a file or directory rm -rf - permanently delete a file or directory mv - rename a file or directory. You can also use it to move a file from one location to another eg. mv /home/jerry/file1.doc /home/jerry/Documents cat - display the contents inside a file mkdir - make a new folder rmdir - remove a folder killall - kill a program with that name man - read the manual for a particular program (type q to exit the manual) CopyLeft Linux Command Reference: Top of page Adding another User Enabling TRIM on your SSD Installation Guide Installing Linux Lite to your computer - UEFI Mode Installing Linux Lite to your computer - Legacy BIOS Mode Drives & Partitions - Mounting Drives & Partitions - Automount Drives & Partitions for all users - Automount Windows Partitions for all users - Controlling Access to Mounted Drives - Advanced Users No USB Boot option in the BIOS?

To create a bootable DVD, you need to burn the ISO as an \"image\" to the DVD. Below are listed three free Windows programs that will enable you to do that. If burning to a USB stick, we have also listed a free program that we recommend for doing that in Windows; or a reliable method to create a bootable USB when using a Linux system, or OSX. Once you have your bootable media created, you may need to access your computer's BIOS settings to set the boot order for booting CD/DVD/USB's first (before the hard drive). Typically there will be one or two special keys that can be pressed during initial power-up of the computer (before an operating system starts booting) that will allow you access to either the BIOS Settings/Startup Menu or a separate Boot Menu. Specific keys vary from one manufacturer to the next, so refer to your user manual if you are not sure how to access the settings. Writing the Linux Lite ISO to a USB on Windows A good, simple point and click USB ISO burner is Etcher or Rufus. Links - Etcher Home Page, Rufus Home Page. Guide: - Insert a 4Gb or larger USB stick into your PC. You MUST format the entire USB drive to Fat32 before proceeding. - Install, then start Etcher or Rufus. - Select the Linux Lite ISO file from Etcher or Rufus and write the image to your USB. These instructions are generic for Windows (Rufus is Windows only), Linux and Mac OS. Writing the Linux Lite ISO to a DVD on Windows Here is some free DVD burning software for you to select from: BurnAware Free - http://www.burnaware.com CDBurnerXP - http://cdburnerxp.se/ ImgBurn - http://www.imgburn.com/ Place a blank DVD in your DVD drive, open up the program, select the ISO file that you want to burn. Choose the lowest burn speed, this will greatly reduce the risk of your burn becoming corrupt as can sometimes happen. A 4x or 6x speed is recommended if you have it. The lower the burn speed, the better. Writing the Linux Lite ISO to USB on Linux (see above, the process is similar) Etcher allows you to create a bootable Live USB drive. You will need a 4Gb or larger USB drive. Download Etcher from here. Writing the Linux Lite ISO to USB in Linux and OSX (see above, the process is similar) Using a GUI application You can use Etcher as mentioned above to write the Linux Lite ISO image to a USB. You will need a 4Gb or larger USB drive. Etcher works on - Windows, Mac & Linux. Download it from here. Using a Terminal To find out the letter of your USB stick, open a terminal and type: df -h It is usually listed as /media/yourusername/ or similar. Be very careful to make sure you choose the right drive letter, as you can see in the Filesystem column, my device is /dev/sda1 another clue is the value in the Size column, here it is shown as 7.6G. In this example my device is listed as: /media/jerry/STUFF in the Mounted on column. Open a folder and make sure you are in the directory that the iso file is in. Open a terminal in that directory and type the following: Terminal Command: Change the x in sdx to match the letter of your USB device. In the above example, my device is shown as sda1 (leave out the '1') Example Terminal Command: The Live DVD/USB image will boot into the desktop automatically, there is no need to login manually. No USB Boot option in the BIOS? Use PloP For full instructions click here. Preparing your Computer for the Installation If you are planning to have Linux Lite as the sole operating system on your computer, there is nothing special you need to do in preparation for the installation, even if another operating system is currently occupying the hard drive. Simply boot up your live installation disk, give Linux Lite a test run if you'd like, then start the installation by double-clicking the Install Linux Lite icon on the desktop. When you get to the Installation Type screen, tell the installer to use the whole disk and it will go ahead and erase anything that is already there, create the partitions needed, format them and install the system automatically. If you currently have one physical hard drive and want to dual-boot Windows and Linux Lite, then you should do a few things to prepare for the installation to insure the best results. If you have more than one physical hard drive and want to dual-boot Windows and Linux Lite, with Linux Lite on its own dedicated physical drive, then we recommend you make a request for guidance in our Forum if you are unfamiliar with Linux based installations. Otherwise, general instructions for such an installation are listed below. Top of page Installing Linux Lite to your computer - UEFI Mode Start your computer, and go into your system BIOS and check that the boot order is set so that DVD and USB devices are set to boot first. This varies from BIOS to BIOS. Refer to your motherboard documentation for more information. You are advised to disable Secure Boot and make sure UEFI is set to Enabled in your BIOS. See here for more information before proceeding if you need any more clarification. Once you are happy with your BIOS set up, insert the DVD disc or USB stick into your computer and reboot your computer. You'll be greeted with the following screen. Let the timer run down if you want to boot to the Live session. Make sure Boot Linux Lite 6.6 Live System is highlighted, press the enter key to boot the Live session. This is also a good way to check that all of your hardware is supported. The other options are: Boot Linux Lite 6.6 Live System - boot directly into the Linux Lite Desktop. Direct install Linux Lite 6.6 - install Linux Lite immediately without booting to the Desktop. Compatibility Mode Linux Lite 6.6 - use this option if you're having trouble with the first 2 options. Check for file system corruption - checks the install image for errors, if none are found, it will boot into the Desktop as per usual. Reboot - restart off your computer. Shutdown - turn off your computer. Some of these boot options may or may not appear as they do in the image above. The types of options varies from release to release. NOTE: If you are having any trouble booting Linux Lite after installation, please read through this trouble shooting guide. The computer will go through the boot up process, this may take anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes depending on your hardware. There will also be a compulsory file check, this is checking all of the files on the DVD or USB to ensure they meet file integrity. It is advised not to skip this procedure. The login for the Live user is automatic, there is no need to login. If for some reason you need to login, simply type in linux beneath Other and click on Log In (no password required). Before we proceed, make sure you have an internet connection first. Click here if you need help to get online before you install Linux Lite. Once you've had a look around Linux Lite and are ready to install the first step is to double click on the Install Linux Lite icon on your Desktop. The installer will then open on the desktop and display the first window of the installer. From here you will select your preferred language and view release notes (option not always available) for this version of Linux Lite. Keyboard layout The next step is to select your keyboard language and layout. You may select the language that your keyboard corresponds to on the left and any specialized layout on the right. This is the point where you may select to enable international keys on your keyboard. Though, these options may be changed later. For a faster install, we recommend you leave the default English (US) options here, and adjust your language settings once Linux Lite has been installed and you have rebooted for the first time. Updates and other software After selecting continue, you are presented with some requirements for the installation. Ensure that these requirements are met by viewing a check mark beside them. You may also choose to download any available updates while installing or install third-party software during the installation. NOTE: 'Download updates while installing Linux' Generally we don't recommend ticking it as this will significantly slow down the install process. Updating after a fresh install is recommended and will save you time in the long run. A typical install on today's hardware will take around 10-15 minutes. If you check these 2 boxes, the install could take over an hour or longer. NOTE: 'Install third-party software for graphics and Wi-Fi hardware and additional media formats' Please verify the legal status of the use of the third party software in your country/territory before choosing this option. This option will install codecs for playing media files, and proprietary drivers for some of your hardware. It is a legal requirement for us to inform you of this. Installation type Now it is time to choose the method of installing Linux Lite to your hard disk. You will have several options during this phase of the installer. Erase Disk and Install Linux NOTE: This option will erase your entire hard drive. Make sure this is what you want to do before proceeding. Upon selecting Erase Disk, the installer will automatically select the default partitioning scheme. Click on Install Now to accept the changes. NOTE: This installation option will automatically install the Linux bootloader to the first hard drive on the system. That is typically how most people install and the Linux boot loader offers the choice of booting any other operating systems that are on your computer. However, if your intent is to keep the Windows boot loader in charge of booting the Windows drive and the Windows drive is the first one, then you need to use the 'Something else' installation type. That way you can control the 'Device for boot loader installation' and set it for the specific drive you choose for Linux Lite. Advanced features There are 2 options in here. Use LVM with the new Linux installation and EXPERIMENTAL: Erase disk and use ZFS. ZFS is an advanced filesystem usually found in Servers. Unless you are familiar with ZFS, there is absolutely no need to use it, doing so could corrupt your system if you don't know what you are doing. NOTE: If you choose the Use LVM with the new Linux installation you will be prompted to enter a strong password. This will option will encrypt your entire Linux Lite install. Encrypting is optional and only recommended for people who understand the encryption process. Selecting Erase disk and install Linux will automatically partition your hard drive as shown below. Something else (dual booting or custom partitioning) Select Something else from this screen if you wish to dual boot with Windows or edit existing partitions (or both). Keeping Windows (dual booting) When manual partitioning, set 500mb of space on sda1 as a EFI System Partition (No Windows operating system installed). If you are dual-booting, create a separate partition, do not use sda1. In this example, we have 3 partitions. sda1 - The recovery partition for Windows. sda2 - Where Windows is installed (note ntfs is the Type). sda3 - The spare, unformatted partition. This is where we will install Linux Lite to. Click on the sda3 partition and click the Change button. Select Ext4 journaling file system, place a tick in Format the partition and select / as the Mount point. Click OK. NOTE: If you have any other NTFS drives, it is important to give these a mount point during the install. That way they will be easily accessible after the installation. The mount point is simply \"where\" in the file system you want that partition's files to show up. You can name the mount point what ever you want, be sure to give it a simple, no spaces lowercase name like eg. /myntfs do not use /My NTFS. DO NOT select 'Format the partition' when editing any NTFS partitions. NOTE: If you are manual partitioning here, make sure in the 'Device for boot loader installation:' drop down, you select /dev/sda. Grub must be installed here to the root sda device or you will have trouble booting. This is the case for ALL partitioning options. When you have finished, click on Install Now. Overwriting Windows In this example, we select the sda2 partition (where Windows is installed) and click the Change button. Select Ext4 journaling file system, place a tick in Format the partition and select / as the Mount point. Click OK. NOTE: Device for boot loader installation. The Linux boot loader offers the choice of booting any other operating systems that are on your computer. In this example since we are over writing Windows, we simply select sda for the boot loader. Whichever method you choose, once you are finished, click on Install Now. Where are you? After completing the partitioning phase of the installation, you are prompted to set up some personal details about the system. The installer will continue to work in the background while you are filling out this information. The first step is to select your time zone. The installer may detect your time zone based on your location via your ISP's information. If not, you may select your time zone by either clicking on your region on the supplied map or by typing in your area in the box below. Who are you? On the next screen, you are greeted by several fields to fill. These fields include: Your name - your real, full name. Your computer's name - the name that you wish to use to identify the computer on your network. Pick a username - your user name that is used to login to the system. Choose a password - your password that you wish to use for your user and sudo (administrator) password. Confirm your password - enter the above password again. NOTE: Choose a strong password, a mix of upper and lower case as well as a mix of numbers and characters. An example of this would be: y%9L2x#o would be considered a strong password. Use a program like KeePassXC to keep all your passwords safely stored and NEVER use the same password for different websites. (KeePassXC is available for installation from Menu, Settings, Lite Software. You do not need to download it from their website.) NEVER COMPROMISE YOUR SECURITY FOR CONVENIENCE. There are also options to enable auto-login for your user or have the computer prompt you for a password everytime you login. If you have a webcam, you may encounter a screen during the install asking to Take a photo this feature is supported so that when you first log in, your photo will be displayed as your avatar. If you skip this step, you can use a .png photo of yourself, rename it to .face and place it in your /home/user folder. By default, the Linux Lite logo will represent your login icon. After finishing all of these steps you will be greeted with a slideshow detailing all of the features and software that are included in this version of Linux Lite. You may allow them to play on their own or navigate through them using the arrow buttons on the sides of the window (the picture below may vary from version to version). Once the installation is complete you will be prompted to either restart your computer and begin using your newly installed Linux Lite system or to continue using the testing environment on the DVD/USB that you are using. If for some reason your computer hangs on restart, press F4 or Enter. After a reboot you will be greeted by the login screen: After you have logged in you will see the desktop and Welcome window. Be sure to read through the Welcome window to get you off to the best possible start to using Linux Lite. Install Updates - do this first (reboot if prompted to after updates have finished). Install Drivers - see if there are any drivers needed for your computer. Set a Restore Point - set your first restore point using Timeshift, similar to System Restore in Windows. Install Language Support - if you are using anything other than English. Select Dark or Light Theme - self explanatory. Installing Linux Lite to your computer - Legacy BIOS Mode Once you are happy with your BIOS set up, insert the DVD disc or USB stick into your computer and reboot your computer. You'll be greeted with the following screen. Let the timer run down if you want to boot to the Live session. Make sure Boot Linux Lite 6.6 Live System is highlighted, press the enter key to boot the Live session. This is also a good way to check that all of your hardware is supported. If you are having trouble booting and you get just a black screen, try the second option, Compatibility Mode Linux Lite 6.6. The other options are: Boot Linux Lite 6.6 Live System - boot directly into the Linux Lite Desktop. Direct install Linux Lite 6.6 - install Linux Lite immediately without booting to the Desktop. Compatibility Mode Linux Lite 6.6 - use this option if you're having trouble with the first 2 options.

Now logout and login again and you will see that your new language has been applied. Please note that not all programs may not have your language applied. If this is the case, search for that program in Package Manager and see if there is a language pack available for it. Also note that after you have changed your language, some of the Menu items may not be translated properly. There is little we can do about this, an easy way to rename Menu entries is by going to Menu, Settings, Menu Editor and editing the entries there. Top of page Enabling TRIM on your SSD Trim in Linux Lite Series 5.x and onwards is now a SystemD service that runs automatically weekly. There is no need to set up Trim anymore in Linux Lite. You can get further information regarding Trim in your system by running the following commands in your terminal: Open a terminal and do: Terminal Command: and: Terminal Command: Top of page Drives & Partitions Let's familiarize with the terms drive, partitions and volumes. They are commonly used terms and understanding\twhat they are will help you in the process of mounting drives/partitions. The term drive refers to a physical storage device such as a hard disk, solid-state disk, removable USB flash drive etc. In Linux, devices are represented by special file system objects called device nodes, which are visible under the /dev directory. Storage devices are labeled under /dev according to the type of device, followed by a letter signifying the order in which they were detected by the system. In Linux the prefix sd is used for all PATA, SATA and SCSI devices. For instance, the device files /dev/sda, /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc correspond to the first, second and third device (drive) respectively. A physical storage device (drive) can be divided into multiple logical storage units known as partitions. Each partition will show up under /dev as a separate device node. A number after the device letter signifies the number of the partition. For example, the device node files /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 refer to the first and second partition of the first device (drive). Note that on PCs using MBR partitioning, due to the limit of four primary partitions and the way extended partitions are handled the partition numbering can slightly differ from the actual partition count. The term volume in Linux is related to the Logical Volume Manager (LVM), which can be used to manage mass storage devices. A physical volume is a storage device or partition. A logical volume created by the LVM is a logical storage device which can span multiple physical volumes. Top of page Mounting Drives & Partitions Mounting drives and partitions in Linux Lite is easy. While the following approach is generally acceptable, it imposes some limitations in the way a drive can be used in your system. For instance, the drive will remain mounted as long as the computer is not restarted or the drive is not manually unmounted. You will need to mount the drive after each reboot. Also, as administrator, you can read and write to the drive but no other user will be able to write to the drive or read any of its content. Read on Automount Drives & Partitions for all users section for other options. By default, all drives connected to your computer will show up on the Desktop as well as in Thunar File Manager, as long as the drive in question contains at least one partition. As you may have noticed in the screenshot above, the drive shown is grayed-out, meaning that it is not mounted by default. To mount a drive in Linux Lite, double click the desired drive and type the administrator password when prompted to do so. Mounting drives requires administrative privileges. Once mounted, the drive icon reflects just that (not longer grayed-out)... you are now ready to use the drive. Top of page Automount Drives & Partitions for all users A more user-friendly way to mount drives in Linux Lite is to have them automount at startup and allow all users to read and write to the drive. The instructions below shows how to mount a drive in Linux Lite with automount options and read and write permissions for all users. You can follow these steps to mount as many partitions as you may need. Start by creating a folder to assign a mount point path to the drive. Open Terminal and execute: Terminal Command: ... where disk1 is the name of the folder we are creating and /media is the directory under which it will be created. Then, open Menu, Settings, Disks. Select the disk you want to make available from the left column, then click on Edit Mount Options as shown below. Set the following mount option: Optionally, you could also set a Display Name for your drive, making it easier to identify. The Display Name will be appended to the mount options(3) as you type it. Click OK to apply your changes and enter your password when prompted to do so. Finally, you can either reboot your computer or manually mount the device so that you don't have to reboot. The configured drive will mount automatically on every reboot from there on. All users will be able to read and write on the drive and no prompt for administrative password will be required. To manually mount the drive, click on Mount selected partition (little triangle in the Volumes actions buttons): The selected drive will then be mounted. Repeat these steps to automount other drives (or additional partitions within a drive) as needed. Top of page Automount Windows Partitions for all users Linux Lite can read and write NTFS file systems on external drives by default. To mount a Windows partition, create a new folder to assign a mount point path for the Windows partition. Open Terminal and execute: Terminal Command: ... where disk1 is the name of the folder we are creating and /media is the directory under which it will be created. Make sure to create a new folder for each drive you are mounting in your system. For example, assume you are already using /media/disk1 to automount a different drive or partition, you want to have a different folder to assign a mount point path for the Windows partition then; it can be named anything you want: disk2, disk3, windowsdisk, etc. and make sure to adjust the Mount Point options accordingly in the steps below. Next, open Menu, Settings, Disks, select the disk which contains the Windows partition from the left column, highlight (click) the Windows partition and finally click on Edit Mount Options: Set the following mount option: Click OK to apply your changes and enter your password when prompted to do so. Finally, you can either reboot your computer or manually mount the device so that you don't have to reboot. The configured drive will mount automatically on every reboot from there on. All users will be able to read and write on the drive and no prompt for administrative password will be required. To manually mount the drive, click on Mount selected partition (little triangle in the Volumes actions buttons): The selected drive will then be mounted. Repeat these steps to automount other drives (or additional partitions within a drive) as needed. Top of page Controlling Access to Mounted Drives Usually, you want to mount drives in Linux Lite and make them available to all users. But there are times when controlling access to those drives becomes a necessity. For example, you may want to automount a Windows drive at startup but prevent other users from modifying the contents in that drive; which is certainly important. Maybe you do not want them to see its content at all. There is a simple (yet effective) way for accomplishing just that at the time of mounting drives and partitions; by using uid, gid and umask. A user ID (uid) is a unique positive integer assigned by Linux operating system to each user. Each user is identified to the system by its uid, and user names are generally used only as an interface for humans. The same is true for gid (group ID) but it references groups instead of users. The user file-mode creation mask (umask) is use to determine the file permission for newly created files. It can be used to control the default file permission. Let's put together some examples on how we could set some restrictions at the time of mounting drives. First, we need to know the uid/gid of the administrative account we are using to mount the drive. In this example, our username is liteuser. Open Terminal and execute: Terminal Command: ... where username is your administrator account username; liteuser in our case. For umask, we are going to go with the most common options you'll usually need: umask 222 - Assigns permissions so that everyone has read-only access for files and directories, including your account. umask 077 - Assigns permissions so that only you have read/write access for files, and read/write/search for directories you own. All others have no access permissions to your files or directories. umask 022 - Assigns permissions so that only you have read/write access for files, and read/write/search for directories you own. All others have read access only to your files, and read/search access to your directories. umask 002 - Assigns permissions so that only you and members of your group have read/write access to files, and read/write/search access to directories you own. All others have read access only to your files, and read/search to your directories. Using Menu, Settings, Disks, mount a drive with some content in it using your uid, gid and umask=077: With the above mount options, this is what liteuser and user1 accounts get to access. Feel free to experiment with umask options, different groups and users. For additional references, see man mount and man umask. Top of page Adding another User To add another User to Linux Lite, click on Menu, Settings, Lite User Manager. Then click on Add New User and enter a name, and the same password twice. Please note, there is a character limit for both your user and the user you are tying to add of 30 characters. If you get an error adding a user, this could be one of the reasons why. To change your own password via the command line, do:. To change someone else's password via the command line (you must have sudo rights to do this), do:. And follow the onscreen instructions. NOTE: Choose a strong password, a mix of upper and lower case as well as a mix of numbers and characters. An example of this would be: would be considered a strong password. Use a program like KeePassXC to keep all your passwords safely stored and NEVER use the same password for different websites and accounts. Never compromise your security for convenience. You will then be asked for your password, enter it and click on OK to finish creating the new user account. The new user will have the same rights as the default user (you) except for Administrator rights meaning they will be unable to modify system settings such as installing software and changing system files. User Permissions If you want your new user to have Administrator rights, in the right hand pane scroll down to sudo, place a tick in the box beside it and click on Apply. You can give the new user other group permissions to by using this method, but out of the box this should not be necessary as by default, the application already does all this for you. Now when the new user next logs in, they will have the same full system rights as you. You will both be 'Administrators'. Removing a User NOTE: Before removing a user account make sure their files are backed up to a usb device or the cloud first. Removing an account also removes all that persons documents, pictures, videos, files etc. This is as easy as selecting the user that you want to remove from the Select user drop down box, clicking on Remove selected user and clicking on Apply. If you are asked for your password, please enter it and then click Ok. Next a confirmation box will appear, read the message and if you want to proceed click on Yes. The user account and all their data has now been removed. Top of page Resetting your Password Forgot your password? It happens to all of us at some stage. Fortunately setting it again is fairly straight forward. Lets begin. Boot up your computer and immediately press and hold down the Shift or ESC key. You should see a screen like this. Next press the e key whilst that top line is highlighted. This will take you to the next screen. Use your arrow keys to move down to the line highlighted in the picture below. Use the arrow key until you reach the end of that line. Press the backspace key repeatedly until you remove: ro splash quiet $vt_handoff and replace that text with: rw init=/bin/bash so that it looks like the picture below. Now press either F10 or Ctrl+X to boot your machine to a command prompt. At the prompt, type: passwd jerry where jerry is your username, then press enter. You will be asked to type in a new password twice. Your password has now been changed. Now we are ready to save those changes, then reboot the computer.Type in: sync then hit enter. Then type in: reboot -f Your computer will reboot. If you see the screen shown below again, just hit enter. This is normal and won't appear the next time you reboot your computer. You may also not see the boot animation on this boot, this to is normal and will reappear next time you boot up. Now login with your password. Top of page Terminal Basics Linux Lite is designed to be such that new users won't have to venture into the terminal to much. But, there will be some occasions where we need to run the odd terminal command. The following is a very basic introduction to some of the more common terminal commands that will help you to navigate around your computer, should you need to. TIP: instead of typing out the entire name of a file or folder, type the first few letters and hit your TAB key, this will auto complete the name. This will save you lots of time but be careful and make sure you have typed the correct file name. In the examples below 'directory' also means 'folder'. When you first open a terminal, your location in the file system will be your home directory. You can confirm that by using the first command listed below, \"pwd\". It will show that you are in \"/home/username\", where \"username\" is your actual username. pwd - shows you the present working directory (the directory you are currently in). If you get lost, just type \"pwd\" and it will tell you where you are in the file system. ls - display a list of files and directories in the current directory ls -la - a more comprehensive listing that displays file properties in the current directory, including hidden files and their properties. cd - change directory, change to another directory. For instance, if you are currently located at /home/username and want to go to your Documents folder, type: cd Documents. If you then type pwd, you will see that your location is now /home/username/Documents. No matter where you are in the terminal typing just cd will return you to your home folder in the terminal. cd .. - go back one directory (up to the parent directory of your current location). cp - copy file to another directory rm - remove a file or directory rm -rf - permanently delete a file or directory mv - rename a file or directory. You can also use it to move a file from one location to another eg. mv /home/jerry/file1.doc /home/jerry/Documents cat - display the contents inside a file mkdir - make a new folder rmdir - remove a folder killall - kill a program with that name man - read the manual for a particular program (type q to exit the manual) CopyLeft Linux Command Reference: Top of page ","tags":"","url":"install.html"},

Your router is most likely already set up to give you an IP address automatically. So in this tutorial we will instead focus on connecting to your router with a static IP address. Make sure Enable Networking has a tick beside it. The first step is to left click on the network tray icon and select Edit Connections. If at any point you are asked to enter your password, please do so. Highlight the Wired connection entry, and click on the Edit (cog) button. Click on the IPv4 or IPv6 tab (consult your ISP on which one to use, IPv4 is the default) and select Manual. Click on the Add button in Addresses an enter in the appropriate numbers. Be sure to include the DNS address. This is typically the same address as your router web login address (just the 4 sets of numbers). Example: Address: 192.168.1.44 Netmask: 24 Gateway: 192.168.1.1 (this is your Router address) DNS Servers: 192.168.1.1 (this is also your Router address) Click on Save to finish. Connecting to the Internet - Wireless In the system tray (near the clock, bottom right hand side of your screen) if you have no connection at the moment you will see a diagonal broken line with a red cross next to it. This denotes that there is no connection currently. Left click on the icon, if your wireless is working, you should have a list of wireless networks in your area, select your network. If you cannot see any wireless networks at all, your wireless device driver may not be installed, or for example your wireless switch on your laptop is in the Off position. If after you have checked this there are still no wireless networks showing, go to Menu, Settings, Install Drivers and see if your wireless device is listed. If it is, install the driver for it and continue with this tutorial. (You will need to connect to the internet using a wired connection in order to download and install the wireless driver.) A box will pop up asking for your wireless password. If you would like to view your password while you type it, tick the 'Show password' box to ensure that you have entered your wireless password correctly. You will then receive a notification in the top right hand corner of your screen once you are connected. After a successful connection, you should see a tray icon like the one shown below. Top of page USB Broadband Modem If you have the Huawei E220 then this should work out of the box. This is a very common modem and we encourage you to use this model if it is possible. Right click on the Network Connections tray icon and select New Mobile Broadband connection. Configure your settings according to the details from your 3g service provider. At this stage no other modems have been tested. Top of page NitroShare - Share files with Linux, Mac & Windows NitroShare allows easy point and click sharing of files between all desktop operating systems including Linux, Mac & Windows. If you are going to use a Firewall: In Linux Lite, the Firewall (disabled by default) has been preconfigured to allow NitroShare traffic. Make sure your Firewall has been set to home before beginning this tutorial if you are going to use a Firewall. See here for more information on this. If you're running Linux Lite make sure you place a tick in nitroshare as shown below. In the Firewall, click on Configuration - Permanent, place a tick in nitroshare as shown below, then click on Options, Reload Firewalld. Let's install NitroShare. Menu, Settings, Lite Software. Enter your password and click on yes to update sources now. Now click on Install Software. Left click on NitroShare and click on Install at the bottom right. Proceed with the installation. When the installation has finished, quit Lite Software. Go to Menu, Internet, NitroShare. Click on the Close button that pops up one time only, and then right click on the NitroShare tray icon and choose Settings. Choose the directory where you want to receive files to. Leave the other settings, unless you want to change them. Click OK when done. Let's send someone else on the network running NitroShare a file. Both computers MUST be on the same network, ie. connected to the same router. Right click on the NitroShare tray icon, select Send Files. Select the file you want to send and click on Open. Select the computer you want to send the file to, and click on OK. Transfer successful. Top of page Accessing a NAS device Many homes now use a NAS or Network Attached Storage device. In this tutorial we'll show you how to access all your media files, then show you how to play them across your network with VLC. When this set up is complete, you'll also be able to copy and paste files between your NAS and your pc just like you did in Windows or Mac. First thing you need to do is find the IP address of your NAS. You may know this already or your NAS manual will show you how to find this. Once you have your NAS's IP address, open up your home folder and type in the following: smb://192.168.1.49 where 192.168.1.49 is your NAS's IP address. Put in the username of the NAS, in most cases it is admin, but again refer to your manual for the correct information. Put in the workgroup (Domain) name, and finally the password for your NAS. Place a dot in Remember forever if you want it to save your details. You should now see all of your NAS folders. Lets look inside the Movies folder for this device, as you can see I have a movie file in there called The Code Story of Linux Documentary.webm Before we can start playing media files across the network, we need to set up VLC so that it can access and play files remotely. In Linux Lite, click on Menu, Multimedia, VLC Media Player. With VLC open, click on Tools, Preferences. In the window that pops up, in the bottom left click on All. Then on the left, expand Input / Codecs, Access modules, SMB. Then put in your NAS's username, password and finally the SMB domain (Workgroup). Click on Save to finish and close VLC. Now that we've given VLC the network credentials it needs to access your NAS, we can browse and play our files. Top of page Network Shares A Network Share is a computer resource made available from one computer to others on a computer network such as files, folders and printers to mention the most common. These resources can be remotely accessed from another computer, typically via a local area network or intranet, transparently as if it were a resource in the local machine. Linux Lite includes the Lite Network Shares application to help in configuring your shares for access from other computers in your network; e.g.: a Windows machine. In Linux, the suite that provides seamless file and print services interoperability for Windows, Linux and Unix is known as Samba. Network Shares - Create Linux Lite Shares This section will guide you on how to create your first Linux Lite share making the process as simple as it really is once you understand the basics: Create a new folder inside your home folder by right-clicking an empty section in your home folder and selecting Create Folder from the context menu pop-up. In this example we will name it: linux_share Next, we need to tell Samba (SMB) who we are going to login as to access our Linux Lite shares. Open up a terminal and type: Terminal Command: sudo smbpasswd -a name ...where name is your Linux Lite username; in our case the username is jerry. For easily remembering the SMB password, you can use the same password for SMB as that in your Linux Lite user account if you wish. You'll be asked to enter the new SMB password twice. Open your home folder, navigate to the /etc/samba/ directory, right click on the file smbusers and Open as Administrator. The file will open in the Text Editor. The smbusers file will contain a username map list (one per line) of your Linux Lite and SMB accounts. We will replace the default linux = \"linux\" in that file with our Linux Lite username in each of the brackets: username = \"username\"... in our case: jerry = \"jerry\" You can now Save and Close the smbusers file, and close the terminal. Open Menu, Settings, Lite Network Shares and click on Edit Share Settings. The configuration file will then open in leafpad text editor. Default settings are shown below: #======================= Global Settings ==================================== [global] workgroup = WORKGROUP server string = Linux Lite Shares netbios name = linux security = user encrypt passwords = true username map = /etc/samba/smbusers map to guest = bad user guest account = nobody dns proxy = no #======================= Share Definitions =================================== [liteshare] path = /home/%U/linux_share available = yes valid users = %U %G write list = %U browsable = yes public = no writable = yes guest ok = no read only = no printable = no locking = no strict locking = no For a first time basic setup, there is no need to change the default settings. You likely only need to verify the following: WORKGROUP - must be equal to the workgroup name in your network. \"WORKGROUP\" is usually the default. netbios name - must be equal to the computer name. In a terminal type in hostname to get your netbios name. jerry@jerryvb:~$ jerryvb is the netbios name / computer name. path = the path to the folder in your home directory where shared files will be stored. ONLY change the\tfolder name part; e.g.: /home/%U/linux_share \" linux_share \" is the folder name in Linux Lite you are sharing from your home folder. \" %U \" is Samba's substitution for the username; meaning same as your username. Leave the %U as it is. Change ONLY the word \" linux_share \" to the name of the folder you created in the first step of this tutorial if you used a different folder name. Save and Close the file, then click on Restart services. You can now access Linux Lite shares from another computer in your network. TIP: Keep pressing F5 in the share folder, sometimes it takes a few seconds for the shares to appear. If at any stage you want to add more share folders, you can simply add more blocks like in the example below: #======================= Global Settings ==================================== [global] workgroup = WORKGROUP server string = Linux Lite Shares netbios name = jerryvb security = user encrypt passwords = true username map = /etc/samba/smbusers map to guest = bad user guest account = nobody dns proxy = no #======================= Share Definitions =================================== [liteshare] path = /home/jerry/linux_share available = yes valid users = %U %G write list = %U browsable = yes public = no writable = yes guest ok = no read only = no printable = no locking = no strict locking = no [videoshare] path = /home/jerry/Videos available = yes valid users = %U %G write list = %U browsable = yes public = no writable = yes guest ok = no read only = no printable = no locking = no strict locking = no [dloadshare] path = /home/jerry/Downloads available = yes valid users = %U %G write list = %U browsable = yes public = no writable = yes guest ok = no read only = no printable = no locking = no strict locking = no Top of page Accessing Linux Lite shares from Windows Go to your Windows machine, in this example we'll use Windows 10. Open up Network in Windows. You should see the Linux Lite machine appear after a short while. If you don't, simply type the ip address of the Linux Lite machine into the address bar with two back slashes in front eg. \\\\192.168.1.199 To get the ip address of your Linux Lite pc, in Linux Lite open a terminal and type ifconfig Look for the inet address. Double click on the machine name. A username and password dialogue box will pop up, enter in the user and password we created in the Create Linux Lite Shares tutorial above. And here we see our Linux Lite computer share folder: All that's left to do is to double click on the Linux Lite share and we will be inside the share folder. Now you can copy and paste files to your Linux Lite computer. Top of page Accessing Windows shares from Linux Lite Go to your Windows machine and find the ip address. To do this, open a command prompt and type in: ipconfig Usually the results at the top has your ip address listed. In the above example, the IPv4 Address is: 192.168.1.49 Make a note of this ip address. Now go back to your Linux Lite computer, and open your home folder. NOTE: If by the end of this Shares tutorial you are still not seeing any shares, try restarting both machines. Also note that sometimes it can take a while before the shares appear. In the address bar, type in: smb://ipaddressofwindowspc where ipaddressofwindowspc is the actual numbered ip address of your Windows computer. If everything went to plan, you should now be prompted for your Windows username, domain or workgroup and your Windows password. Windows username - Windows workgroup name - Windows password Now you can copy and paste files to your Windows computer. NOTE: If the ip address method does not work eg. smb://192.168.1.49 try smb://windowspc where windowspc is the netbios name of the Windows computer. NOTE: If you are still not having any luck with either method, try NitroShare, a cross-platform network sharing application for Windows, Mac and Linux. You can view a video tutorial on it here. Another method you could consider is setting up an FTP server on your Windows computer and connecting to it with Filezilla, available from Menu, Settings, Lite Software. Top of page Remote Access with VNC Here is a quick tutorial on how to configure x11vnc (VNC Server) for remote access/control to your Linux Lite PC via VNC client. Start by installing x11vnc from Terminal with: Terminal Command: sudo apt install -y x11vnc Next, let’s create a directory to store a file that will contain the password used for VNC authentication: Terminal Command: sudo mkdir /etc/x11vnc Now we'll create an encrypted password file and save it in /etc/x11vnc/. You will be prompted to type and verify the password: Terminal Command: sudo x11vnc --storepasswd /etc/x11vnc/vncpwd Now we will create the systemd service file for the x11vnc service: Terminal Command: pkexec mousepad /lib/systemd/system/x11vnc.service Copy & paste the code below into the Text Editor: [Unit] Description=VNC Server for X11 Requires=display-manager.service After=display-manager.service [Service] Type=forking ExecStart=/usr/bin/x11vnc -dontdisconnect -auth guess -forever -shared -noxdamage -repeat -rfbauth /etc/x11vnc/vncpwd -rfbport 5900 -bg -o /var/log/x11vnc.log ExecStop=/usr/bin/killall x11vnc Restart=on-failure Restart-sec=5 [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target Save changes and close leafpad. Then copy /lib/systemd/system/x11vnc.service to /etc/systemd/system/ Terminal Command: sudo cp /lib/systemd/system/x11vnc.service /etc/systemd/system/ Next, let’s edit /lib/systemd/system/graphical.target Terminal Command: pkexec mousepad /lib/systemd/system/graphical.target Update graphical.target file content as shown below: # This file is part of systemd. # # systemd is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it # under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by # the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or # (at your option) any later version.

Open your home folder, navigate to the /etc/samba/ directory, right click on the file smbusers and Open as Administrator. The file will open in the Text Editor. The smbusers file will contain a username map list (one per line) of your Linux Lite and SMB accounts. We will replace the default linux = \"linux\" in that file with our Linux Lite username in each of the brackets: username = \"username\"... in our case: jerry = \"jerry\" You can now Save and Close the smbusers file, and close the terminal. Open Menu, Settings, Lite Network Shares and click on Edit Share Settings. The configuration file will then open in leafpad text editor. Default settings are shown below: #======================= Global Settings ==================================== [global] workgroup = WORKGROUP server string = Linux Lite Shares netbios name = linux security = user encrypt passwords = true username map = /etc/samba/smbusers map to guest = bad user guest account = nobody dns proxy = no #======================= Share Definitions =================================== [liteshare] path = /home/%U/linux_share available = yes valid users = %U %G write list = %U browsable = yes public = no writable = yes guest ok = no read only = no printable = no locking = no strict locking = no For a first time basic setup, there is no need to change the default settings. You likely only need to verify the following: WORKGROUP - must be equal to the workgroup name in your network. \"WORKGROUP\" is usually the default. netbios name - must be equal to the computer name. In a terminal type in hostname to get your netbios name. jerry@jerryvb:~$ jerryvb is the netbios name / computer name. path = the path to the folder in your home directory where shared files will be stored. ONLY change the\tfolder name part; e.g.: /home/%U/linux_share \" linux_share \" is the folder name in Linux Lite you are sharing from your home folder. \" %U \" is Samba's substitution for the username; meaning same as your username. Leave the %U as it is. Change ONLY the word \" linux_share \" to the name of the folder you created in the first step of this tutorial if you used a different folder name. Save and Close the file, then click on Restart services. You can now access Linux Lite shares from another computer in your network. TIP: Keep pressing F5 in the share folder, sometimes it takes a few seconds for the shares to appear. If at any stage you want to add more share folders, you can simply add more blocks like in the example below: #======================= Global Settings ==================================== [global] workgroup = WORKGROUP server string = Linux Lite Shares netbios name = jerryvb security = user encrypt passwords = true username map = /etc/samba/smbusers map to guest = bad user guest account = nobody dns proxy = no #======================= Share Definitions =================================== [liteshare] path = /home/jerry/linux_share available = yes valid users = %U %G write list = %U browsable = yes public = no writable = yes guest ok = no read only = no printable = no locking = no strict locking = no [videoshare] path = /home/jerry/Videos available = yes valid users = %U %G write list = %U browsable = yes public = no writable = yes guest ok = no read only = no printable = no locking = no strict locking = no [dloadshare] path = /home/jerry/Downloads available = yes valid users = %U %G write list = %U browsable = yes public = no writable = yes guest ok = no read only = no printable = no locking = no strict locking = no Top of page Accessing Linux Lite shares from Windows Go to your Windows machine, in this example we'll use Windows 10. Open up Network in Windows. You should see the Linux Lite machine appear after a short while. If you don't, simply type the ip address of the Linux Lite machine into the address bar with two back slashes in front eg. \\\\192.168.1.199 To get the ip address of your Linux Lite pc, in Linux Lite open a terminal and type ifconfig Look for the inet address. Double click on the machine name. A username and password dialogue box will pop up, enter in the user and password we created in the Create Linux Lite Shares tutorial above. And here we see our Linux Lite computer share folder: All that's left to do is to double click on the Linux Lite share and we will be inside the share folder. Now you can copy and paste files to your Linux Lite computer. Top of page Accessing Windows shares from Linux Lite Go to your Windows machine and find the ip address. To do this, open a command prompt and type in: ipconfig Usually the results at the top has your ip address listed. In the above example, the IPv4 Address is: 192.168.1.49 Make a note of this ip address. Now go back to your Linux Lite computer, and open your home folder. NOTE: If by the end of this Shares tutorial you are still not seeing any shares, try restarting both machines. Also note that sometimes it can take a while before the shares appear. In the address bar, type in: smb://ipaddressofwindowspc where ipaddressofwindowspc is the actual numbered ip address of your Windows computer. If everything went to plan, you should now be prompted for your Windows username, domain or workgroup and your Windows password. Windows username - Windows workgroup name - Windows password Now you can copy and paste files to your Windows computer. NOTE: If the ip address method does not work eg. smb://192.168.1.49 try smb://windowspc where windowspc is the netbios name of the Windows computer. NOTE: If you are still not having any luck with either method, try NitroShare, a cross-platform network sharing application for Windows, Mac and Linux. You can view a video tutorial on it here. Another method you could consider is setting up an FTP server on your Windows computer and connecting to it with Filezilla, available from Menu, Settings, Lite Software. Top of page Remote Access with VNC Here is a quick tutorial on how to configure x11vnc (VNC Server) for remote access/control to your Linux Lite PC via VNC client. Start by installing x11vnc from Terminal with: Terminal Command: sudo apt install -y x11vnc Next, let’s create a directory to store a file that will contain the password used for VNC authentication: Terminal Command: sudo mkdir /etc/x11vnc Now we'll create an encrypted password file and save it in /etc/x11vnc/. You will be prompted to type and verify the password: Terminal Command: sudo x11vnc --storepasswd /etc/x11vnc/vncpwd Now we will create the systemd service file for the x11vnc service: Terminal Command: pkexec mousepad /lib/systemd/system/x11vnc.service Copy & paste the code below into the Text Editor: [Unit] Description=VNC Server for X11 Requires=display-manager.service After=display-manager.service [Service] Type=forking ExecStart=/usr/bin/x11vnc -dontdisconnect -auth guess -forever -shared -noxdamage -repeat -rfbauth /etc/x11vnc/vncpwd -rfbport 5900 -bg -o /var/log/x11vnc.log ExecStop=/usr/bin/killall x11vnc Restart=on-failure Restart-sec=5 [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target Save changes and close leafpad.

In this tutorial we'll show you how to access all your media files, then show you how to play them across your network with VLC. When this set up is complete, you'll also be able to copy and paste files between your NAS and your pc just like you did in Windows or Mac. First thing you need to do is find the IP address of your NAS. You may know this already or your NAS manual will show you how to find this. Once you have your NAS's IP address, open up your home folder and type in the following: smb://192.168.1.49 where 192.168.1.49 is your NAS's IP address. Put in the username of the NAS, in most cases it is admin, but again refer to your manual for the correct information. Put in the workgroup (Domain) name, and finally the password for your NAS. Place a dot in Remember forever if you want it to save your details. You should now see all of your NAS folders. Lets look inside the Movies folder for this device, as you can see I have a movie file in there called The Code Story of Linux Documentary.webm Before we can start playing media files across the network, we need to set up VLC so that it can access and play files remotely. In Linux Lite, click on Menu, Multimedia, VLC Media Player. With VLC open, click on Tools, Preferences. In the window that pops up, in the bottom left click on All. Then on the left, expand Input / Codecs, Access modules, SMB. Then put in your NAS's username, password and finally the SMB domain (Workgroup). Click on Save to finish and close VLC. Now that we've given VLC the network credentials it needs to access your NAS, we can browse and play our files. Top of page Network Shares A Network Share is a computer resource made available from one computer to others on a computer network such as files, folders and printers to mention the most common. These resources can be remotely accessed from another computer, typically via a local area network or intranet, transparently as if it were a resource in the local machine. Linux Lite includes the Lite Network Shares application to help in configuring your shares for access from other computers in your network; e.g.: a Windows machine. In Linux, the suite that provides seamless file and print services interoperability for Windows, Linux and Unix is known as Samba. Network Shares - Create Linux Lite Shares This section will guide you on how to create your first Linux Lite share making the process as simple as it really is once you understand the basics: Create a new folder inside your home folder by right-clicking an empty section in your home folder and selecting Create Folder from the context menu pop-up. In this example we will name it: linux_share Next, we need to tell Samba (SMB) who we are going to login as to access our Linux Lite shares. Open up a terminal and type: Terminal Command: sudo smbpasswd -a name ...where name is your Linux Lite username; in our case the username is jerry. For easily remembering the SMB password, you can use the same password for SMB as that in your Linux Lite user account if you wish. You'll be asked to enter the new SMB password twice.

Network Shares - Create Linux Lite Shares This section will guide you on how to create your first Linux Lite share making the process as simple as it really is once you understand the basics: Create a new folder inside your home folder by right-clicking an empty section in your home folder and selecting Create Folder from the context menu pop-up. In this example we will name it: linux_share Next, we need to tell Samba (SMB) who we are going to login as to access our Linux Lite shares. Open up a terminal and type: Terminal Command: sudo smbpasswd -a name ...where name is your Linux Lite username; in our case the username is jerry. For easily remembering the SMB password, you can use the same password for SMB as that in your Linux Lite user account if you wish. You'll be asked to enter the new SMB password twice. Open your home folder, navigate to the /etc/samba/ directory, right click on the file smbusers and Open as Administrator. The file will open in the Text Editor. The smbusers file will contain a username map list (one per line) of your Linux Lite and SMB accounts. We will replace the default linux = \"linux\" in that file with our Linux Lite username in each of the brackets: username = \"username\"... in our case: jerry = \"jerry\" You can now Save and Close the smbusers file, and close the terminal. Open Menu, Settings, Lite Network Shares and click on Edit Share Settings. The configuration file will then open in leafpad text editor. Default settings are shown below: #======================= Global Settings ==================================== [global] workgroup = WORKGROUP server string = Linux Lite Shares netbios name = linux security = user encrypt passwords = true username map = /etc/samba/smbusers map to guest = bad user guest account = nobody dns proxy = no #======================= Share Definitions =================================== [liteshare] path = /home/%U/linux_share available = yes valid users = %U %G write list = %U browsable = yes public = no writable = yes guest ok = no read only = no printable = no locking = no strict locking = no For a first time basic setup, there is no need to change the default settings. You likely only need to verify the following: WORKGROUP - must be equal to the workgroup name in your network. \"WORKGROUP\" is usually the default. netbios name - must be equal to the computer name. In a terminal type in hostname to get your netbios name. jerry@jerryvb:~$ jerryvb is the netbios name / computer name. path = the path to the folder in your home directory where shared files will be stored. ONLY change the\tfolder name part; e.g.: /home/%U/linux_share \" linux_share \" is the folder name in Linux Lite you are sharing from your home folder. \" %U \" is Samba's substitution for the username; meaning same as your username. Leave the %U as it is. Change ONLY the word \" linux_share \" to the name of the folder you created in the first step of this tutorial if you used a different folder name. Save and Close the file, then click on Restart services. You can now access Linux Lite shares from another computer in your network. TIP: Keep pressing F5 in the share folder, sometimes it takes a few seconds for the shares to appear. If at any stage you want to add more share folders, you can simply add more blocks like in the example below: #======================= Global Settings ==================================== [global] workgroup = WORKGROUP server string = Linux Lite Shares netbios name = jerryvb security = user encrypt passwords = true username map = /etc/samba/smbusers map to guest = bad user guest account = nobody dns proxy = no #======================= Share Definitions =================================== [liteshare] path = /home/jerry/linux_share available = yes valid users = %U %G write list = %U browsable = yes public = no writable = yes guest ok = no read only = no printable = no locking = no strict locking = no [videoshare] path = /home/jerry/Videos available = yes valid users = %U %G write list = %U browsable = yes public = no writable = yes guest ok = no read only = no printable = no locking = no strict locking = no [dloadshare] path = /home/jerry/Downloads available = yes valid users = %U %G write list = %U browsable = yes public = no writable = yes guest ok = no read only = no printable = no locking = no strict locking = no Top of page Accessing Linux Lite shares from Windows Go to your Windows machine, in this example we'll use Windows 10. Open up Network in Windows. You should see the Linux Lite machine appear after a short while. If you don't, simply type the ip address of the Linux Lite machine into the address bar with two back slashes in front eg. \\\\192.168.1.199 To get the ip address of your Linux Lite pc, in Linux Lite open a terminal and type ifconfig Look for the inet address. Double click on the machine name. A username and password dialogue box will pop up, enter in the user and password we created in the Create Linux Lite Shares tutorial above. And here we see our Linux Lite computer share folder: All that's left to do is to double click on the Linux Lite share and we will be inside the share folder. Now you can copy and paste files to your Linux Lite computer. Top of page Accessing Windows shares from Linux Lite Go to your Windows machine and find the ip address. To do this, open a command prompt and type in: ipconfig Usually the results at the top has your ip address listed. In the above example, the IPv4 Address is: 192.168.1.49 Make a note of this ip address. Now go back to your Linux Lite computer, and open your home folder. NOTE: If by the end of this Shares tutorial you are still not seeing any shares, try restarting both machines. Also note that sometimes it can take a while before the shares appear. In the address bar, type in: smb://ipaddressofwindowspc where ipaddressofwindowspc is the actual numbered ip address of your Windows computer. If everything went to plan, you should now be prompted for your Windows username, domain or workgroup and your Windows password. Windows username - Windows workgroup name - Windows password Now you can copy and paste files to your Windows computer. NOTE: If the ip address method does not work eg. smb://192.168.1.49 try smb://windowspc where windowspc is the netbios name of the Windows computer. NOTE: If you are still not having any luck with either method, try NitroShare, a cross-platform network sharing application for Windows, Mac and Linux. You can view a video tutorial on it here. Another method you could consider is setting up an FTP server on your Windows computer and connecting to it with Filezilla, available from Menu, Settings, Lite Software. Top of page Remote Access with VNC Here is a quick tutorial on how to configure x11vnc (VNC Server) for remote access/control to your Linux Lite PC via VNC client. Start by installing x11vnc from Terminal with: Terminal Command: sudo apt install -y x11vnc Next, let’s create a directory to store a file that will contain the password used for VNC authentication: Terminal Command: sudo mkdir /etc/x11vnc Now we'll create an encrypted password file and save it in /etc/x11vnc/. You will be prompted to type and verify the password: Terminal Command: sudo x11vnc --storepasswd /etc/x11vnc/vncpwd Now we will create the systemd service file for the x11vnc service: Terminal Command: pkexec mousepad /lib/systemd/system/x11vnc.service Copy & paste the code below into the Text Editor: [Unit] Description=VNC Server for X11 Requires=display-manager.service After=display-manager.service [Service] Type=forking ExecStart=/usr/bin/x11vnc -dontdisconnect -auth guess -forever -shared -noxdamage -repeat -rfbauth /etc/x11vnc/vncpwd -rfbport 5900 -bg -o /var/log/x11vnc.log ExecStop=/usr/bin/killall x11vnc Restart=on-failure Restart-sec=5 [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target Save changes and close leafpad. Then copy /lib/systemd/system/x11vnc.service to /etc/systemd/system/ Terminal Command: sudo cp /lib/systemd/system/x11vnc.service /etc/systemd/system/ Next, let’s edit /lib/systemd/system/graphical.target Terminal Command: pkexec mousepad /lib/systemd/system/graphical.target Update graphical.target file content as shown below: # This file is part of systemd. # # systemd is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it # under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by # the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or # (at your option) any later version.

Your router is most likely already set up to give you an IP address automatically. So in this tutorial we will instead focus on connecting to your router with a static IP address. Make sure Enable Networking has a tick beside it. The first step is to left click on the network tray icon and select Edit Connections. If at any point you are asked to enter your password, please do so. Highlight the Wired connection entry, and click on the Edit (cog) button. Click on the IPv4 or IPv6 tab (consult your ISP on which one to use, IPv4 is the default) and select Manual. Click on the Add button in Addresses an enter in the appropriate numbers. Be sure to include the DNS address. This is typically the same address as your router web login address (just the 4 sets of numbers). Example: Address: 192.168.1.44 Netmask: 24 Gateway: 192.168.1.1 (this is your Router address) DNS Servers: 192.168.1.1 (this is also your Router address) Click on Save to finish. Connecting to the Internet - Wireless In the system tray (near the clock, bottom right hand side of your screen) if you have no connection at the moment you will see a diagonal broken line with a red cross next to it. This denotes that there is no connection currently. Left click on the icon, if your wireless is working, you should have a list of wireless networks in your area, select your network. If you cannot see any wireless networks at all, your wireless device driver may not be installed, or for example your wireless switch on your laptop is in the Off position. If after you have checked this there are still no wireless networks showing, go to Menu, Settings, Install Drivers and see if your wireless device is listed. If it is, install the driver for it and continue with this tutorial. (You will need to connect to the internet using a wired connection in order to download and install the wireless driver.) A box will pop up asking for your wireless password. If you would like to view your password while you type it, tick the 'Show password' box to ensure that you have entered your wireless password correctly. You will then receive a notification in the top right hand corner of your screen once you are connected. After a successful connection, you should see a tray icon like the one shown below. Top of page USB Broadband Modem If you have the Huawei E220 then this should work out of the box. This is a very common modem and we encourage you to use this model if it is possible. Right click on the Network Connections tray icon and select New Mobile Broadband connection. Configure your settings according to the details from your 3g service provider. At this stage no other modems have been tested. Top of page NitroShare - Share files with Linux, Mac & Windows NitroShare allows easy point and click sharing of files between all desktop operating systems including Linux, Mac & Windows. If you are going to use a Firewall: In Linux Lite, the Firewall (disabled by default) has been preconfigured to allow NitroShare traffic. Make sure your Firewall has been set to home before beginning this tutorial if you are going to use a Firewall. See here for more information on this. If you're running Linux Lite make sure you place a tick in nitroshare as shown below. In the Firewall, click on Configuration - Permanent, place a tick in nitroshare as shown below, then click on Options, Reload Firewalld. Let's install NitroShare. Menu, Settings, Lite Software. Enter your password and click on yes to update sources now. Now click on Install Software. Left click on NitroShare and click on Install at the bottom right. Proceed with the installation. When the installation has finished, quit Lite Software. Go to Menu, Internet, NitroShare. Click on the Close button that pops up one time only, and then right click on the NitroShare tray icon and choose Settings. Choose the directory where you want to receive files to. Leave the other settings, unless you want to change them. Click OK when done. Let's send someone else on the network running NitroShare a file. Both computers MUST be on the same network, ie. connected to the same router. Right click on the NitroShare tray icon, select Send Files. Select the file you want to send and click on Open. Select the computer you want to send the file to, and click on OK. Transfer successful. Top of page Accessing a NAS device Many homes now use a NAS or Network Attached Storage device. In this tutorial we'll show you how to access all your media files, then show you how to play them across your network with VLC. When this set up is complete, you'll also be able to copy and paste files between your NAS and your pc just like you did in Windows or Mac. First thing you need to do is find the IP address of your NAS. You may know this already or your NAS manual will show you how to find this. Once you have your NAS's IP address, open up your home folder and type in the following: smb://192.168.1.49 where 192.168.1.49 is your NAS's IP address. Put in the username of the NAS, in most cases it is admin, but again refer to your manual for the correct information. Put in the workgroup (Domain) name, and finally the password for your NAS. Place a dot in Remember forever if you want it to save your details. You should now see all of your NAS folders. Lets look inside the Movies folder for this device, as you can see I have a movie file in there called The Code Story of Linux Documentary.webm Before we can start playing media files across the network, we need to set up VLC so that it can access and play files remotely. In Linux Lite, click on Menu, Multimedia, VLC Media Player. With VLC open, click on Tools, Preferences. In the window that pops up, in the bottom left click on All. Then on the left, expand Input / Codecs, Access modules, SMB. Then put in your NAS's username, password and finally the SMB domain (Workgroup). Click on Save to finish and close VLC. Now that we've given VLC the network credentials it needs to access your NAS, we can browse and play our files. Top of page Network Shares A Network Share is a computer resource made available from one computer to others on a computer network such as files, folders and printers to mention the most common. These resources can be remotely accessed from another computer, typically via a local area network or intranet, transparently as if it were a resource in the local machine. Linux Lite includes the Lite Network Shares application to help in configuring your shares for access from other computers in your network; e.g.: a Windows machine.

The vast majority of programs that you may want/need to install are all centrally located in what are called software repositories (repos). Rather than searching the web, downloading programs from various sites (some of which may not be reliable), running the installer, rebooting, etc., available software is all centrally located and available for installation in seconds. The packages/(programs) in the repositories are tested, approved for inclusion in the repos and securely signed to insure their validity. There are a few common methods for installing and removing software. Linux Lite comes with Lite Software and Package Manager (Synaptic Package Manager) applications. When the program you want is not listed in Lite Software and you already know its name, Package Manager (Synaptic Package Manager) makes installing easy. IMPORTANT: Before you run Package Manager for the first time, read this first. Then come back to here to learn how to install and remove software. Installing Software 1. Click on Menu, System, Package Manager and enter your password when prompted. 2. Make sure All is selected in the left pane and in the Quick Filter or spy glass: type in your search query. In this example we will search for the 'audacious' music player. 3. Double click on the package you want to install. 4. Some software will ask you to Mark additional required changes? These are also known as dependencies and are required for the program to function properly. 5. Click on Mark. Now hit the Apply button on the Synaptic toolbar. The software will install and a Menu entry will be created in the relevant Menu category. For audacious the Menu category would be Multimedia. 6. Go to the Menu and your new software will be there under the relative Category. An alternative way to find your new software is to click on Menu, Accessories, Application Finder. Type your program name in the Search box and the result will display on the right. Double click on the program name and it will launch for you. Uninstalling Software 1. Uninstalling software is the reverse process of installing software in Package Manager (Synaptic Package Manager). Type the name of the software into the Quick Filter or the spy glass box: 2. Right click on the software and select Mark for Removal. Now hit the Apply button on the Synaptic toolbar and your software will uninstall. Be very careful with this process as you can inadvertently uninstall crucial system software. If you have any doubts, please search the net first to see if it is safe to uninstall the software. Synaptic is pretty good at warning you should there be any potential problems. Top of page Installing Software - From Source Code There will be times when you need to compile and install an application or driver from source code. Here's what you do. In this example, we'll install an application (Pidgin) from source code. Most source code packages will come in a compressed archive format. Let's right click on the archive and select Extract Here. We'll go into the newly extracted folder, right click, Open Terminal Here and enter the following command: Terminal Command: ./configure It will now go through and make sure we have all the tools we need to compile this software.. As we can see from below, it needs some software called intltool. Lets go ahead and install that with apt-get. Now that our required package is installed, we can try to ./configure again. TIP: Search the error messages in Google, they should lead you to the package that you need to install. Keep working through the information in the Terminal until ./configure works properly. At last, a successful ./configure. Now we can compile the actual application with the make command. Terminal Command: make This process can take quite a while, so let it run it's course. The make command has completed without errors. Now to install the application. Here we use the sudo make install command. Enter your password when prompted: Terminal Command: sudo make install Once our program has installed, we can run the application command (pidgin) from the Terminal. Note that we place a space and the & symbol at the end. This is so that we can still run the application and close the Terminal. Our application in action. To Uninstall an application from Source Code: Open a Terminal from inside the source code folder of the application you want to remove and enter the following command: Terminal Command: sudo make uninstall Enter your password. Application successfully removed. Top of page Installing Software - From a Deb Package There may be applications that can only be installed via a deb package. Let's show you how to do this. In this example, we'll install Teamviewer. Once we have our deb package downloaded, right click on it and select Open With GDebi Package Installer. Enter your password. A new Package Installer window will pop up. Click on Install Package. The package installer will download any dependencies that application needs and will install the application. The deb package has been installed. Keep the original package incase you ever want to uninstall it. To Uninstall an application from a Deb Package: Double click on the original package, enter your password. Choose Remove Package. If you don't have the package anymore, open a terminal and enter the application name with the removal command: Terminal Command: sudo dpkg -r teamviewer Enter your password. The application has been removed. Top of page Installing Software - From a Terminal using APT Another way to install and remove software, is from the Terminal using the APT (Advanced Package Tool) system. From Wikipedia - 'APT, is a free-software user interface that works with core libraries to handle the installation and removal of software on Debian, Ubuntu, and related Linux distributions.' like Linux Lite. In the following examples, we'll use APT to install, remove, manage and get information from the software known as Ristretto (in most cases). Installing Software. 1. Open a Terminal and type the following, followed by your password. Terminal Command: sudo apt update This command ensures we are getting the latest versions of all software from within that repository. 2. Now, type in the following to install Ristretto: (all package/software names are always in lower-case) Terminal Command: sudo apt install ristretto Removing Software. 1. Open a Terminal and type the following, followed by your password. Then press the Enter key to confirm the removal process.

Top of page Wine - Run Windows programs Wine application is a compatibility layer capable of running many Windows programs in Linux. Software programs are designed for different operating systems, and most won't work on systems that they weren't designed for. Windows programs won't natively run in Linux because they contain instructions that the system can't understand until they're translated by the Windows environment. In that same way, Linux programs won't run under the Windows operating system because Windows is unable to interpret all of their instructions. Through Wine's compatibility layer, when a Windows program tries to perform a function that Linux doesn't normally understand, Wine will translate that program's instruction into one supported by Linux. More information can be found here - https://www.winehq.org/. Credit to ralphy for this article. Top of page Lite Tweaks Lite Tweaks is a program to customize, optimize and clean up your system. Used periodically it can do things like clean out various cached files, empty the trash, remove old kernels from the system if new ones are installed, remove old dependency packages no longer needed and more, freeing up additional space in your hard drive. NOTE: For the duration that you have Lite Tweaks open, you will be asked for your password only once when you perform Administrative tasks. Lite Tweaks can be found under Menu, Settings, Lite Tweaks. Once opened, the Lite Tweaks window features multiple tasks, alphabetically organized by their Name by default. The Description column provides information related to the task(s) to be performed. Users can select either a single or multiple tasks for execution. They will be executed in sequential order until every selected task has been completed. Simply select the tasks you want to complete and click on Begin. Some of the tasks in Lite Tweaks require administrative privileges for execution, hence you will be prompted for your password when needed. Another example, let's use Lite Tweaks kernel cleaner to remove an old linux kernel. Select Kernel Removal, then click on Begin. Enter your password if requested to. The kernel cleaner will only display the kernels that are not currently in use. To remove a kernel, make sure to select the \"image\" and \"header\" files that correspond to the version number of the kernel, then click Remove. A confirmation box will pop-up. Click Yes if you are sure you want to proceed with the kernel removal. Your kernel(s) will then be removed. (This may take a few minutes.) Upon completion, click OK to close the window. When selected tasks have completed, you'll be returned to the Lite Tweaks main window. Top of page Lite Tweaks - Bootup Fix Bootup Fix is used to restore the Linux Lite splash screen (screen shown while booting up Linux Lite) if it ever gets overwritten with the Ubuntu splash by a system update or otherwise. This task requires administrative privileges for execution. Top of page Lite Tweaks - Clear Memory Clear Memory will clear the PageCache, dentries and inodes in your system. The Linux Kernel uses some of your system memory for caching and buffering. Linux is designed in such a way that it looks into the cache before looking onto the hard disk. If it finds the resource in the cache, then the request doesn’t reach the disk, which in turn helps speeding things up. When you clean the cache, the disk cache will be less useful as the operating system will look for the requested resource in the hard drive. Moreover, it will also slow the system for a few seconds while the cache is cleaned and every resource required by the OS is loaded again\tas needed. You should not need to manually clear memory in your system as a general rule; but Lite Tweaks provides an easy way to do so without having to reboot the computer. Top of page Lite Tweaks - Default Web Browser Default Web Browser is a user preference tweak used to, as its name implies, set the user preferred web browser in Linux Lite. Currently, it recognizes and offers support for the following browsers: While XFCE provides a way to set the preferred application for various services (see Menu, Settings, Preferred Applications), not all applications will follow the default browser setting when multiple browsers are installed in the system and not all browsers are recognized by the Preferred Applications program. Therefore, Lite Tweaks provides the means to overcome this inconvenience ensuring that all internet links will be handled by the user defined browser when Default Web Browser tweak is used. To set your default browser, open Menu, Settings, Lite Tweaks, select Default Web Browser from the list and click on Begin. If you have more than one browser installed in your system and notice that not all applications are following your default browser preference setting, Default Web Browser tweak will help you address it. Top of page Lite Tweaks - Hibernate, Suspend Hibernate, Suspend is a user preference tweak used to show or hide the Hibernate, Suspend, Hybrid Sleep and Switch User buttons on the Logout screen. By default, all Log Out options are displayed in Linux Lite's Logout screen. Some PCs do not properly support Hibernate or Suspend in Linux and a user could unintentionally click one of these Logout options while on the Logout screen. It could otherwise be just a personal preference; users who do not hibernate or suspend the computer may not want these buttons on the logout screen. Lite Tweaks provides a way to hide them if desired. Select an option, then click on the Apply Action button.. You will need to reboot your computer for the changes to take affect. Hibernate and Suspend buttons disabled. Hibernate, Suspend, Hybrid Sleep and Switch User buttons disabled. Top of page Updates Notifications Updates Notifications can be set to a variety of suitable intervals. An updates check will run in the background and display an onscreen notification when there are updates available for your computer. To begin, right click on the updates icon in your tray and select Preferences. Select your preferred updates frequency. The default is twice a day. Click on Close. To disable updates notifications, click on Menu, Settings, Session and Startup, Application Autostart tab and untick Package Update Indicator. To enable updates notifications, click on Menu, Settings, Session and Startup, Application Autostart tab and place a tick in Package Update Indicator. Updates Notifications will check for new updates on schedule as defined by the user. If no new updates are available since the last time updates were installed in the system, there will be no new notifications until new updates become available. Top of page Adding a PPA A PPA is a repository containing one or more applications. These are often set up for new software programs or updated versions of some applications. To add a new PPA to your system, follow the guide below. NOTE: You must ensure that the PPA you are adding, is currently supported by the version of Linux Lite you are using. Only use the following PPAs in Linux Lite. If the following PPAs are not displayed, then you cannot use them. If you try to use PPAs that are not supported, you will not be able to receive important system Updates. - Jammy: Linux Lite 6.x Series (fluorite) - Focal: Linux Lite 5.x Series (emerald) - Bionic: Linux Lite 4.x Series (diamond) - Xenial: Linux Lite 3.x Series (citrine) - Trusty: Linux Lite 2.x Series (beryl) Click on Menu and type in software in the search box. The top result should be Software & Updates. Example: For this PPA, Trusty, Xenial, Bionic and Focal are supported, therefore this PPA is compatible with Linux Lite versions: 2x, 3x. 4x and 5x. If Trusty, Xenial, Bionic and Focal were not listed, you would not be able to use this PPA. In the following example, we are going to add the Simple Screen Recorder PPA. With Software & Updates open, click on the Add button and copy and paste from the web page, the ppa address of: ppa:maarten-baert/simplescreenrecorder. Now click on the Add Source button. To finish, click on Close. You'll be prompted to put in your password. Click on the Reload button, the new source will be added to updates, and your new PPA will be loaded. Now got to Menu, System, Package Manager and search for your application in the Search box, in this example simplescreenrecorder. Now double click on it to install the program. Click on the Apply button at the top of the window, and follow the on screen instructions. Your new PPA application is now installed. Top of page Removing a PPA If for some reason we want to remove a PPA, here's how to do it. Your removing a PPA because you no longer need or wish to run a particular piece of software, so be sure to uninstall that software before removing the PPA that is associated with it. Instructions on uninstalling software can be found here. 1. Click on the Menu, and type in software. Click on Software & Updates. 2. Click on the Other Software tab. Select the PPA you wish to remove, be sure to select the PPA that has the ticked box next to it only, then click on the Remove button. Enter your password. 3. Click on the Close button in the next dialogue box and you'll then be asked to reload your sources. Enter your password if requested to. Click on Reload. 4. The PPA removal process is now complete. Top of page File Encryption In todays world, security of your personal files is important. Whether your transporting documents on a USB drive or emailing sensitive information to a friend, colleague or company, encryption is a necessary security measure. 1. First we need to install the encryption software, in this example we'll use mcrypt. Encryption algorithms include DES, Blowfish, ARCFOUR, Enigma, GOST, LOKI97, RC2, Serpent, Threeway, Twofish, WAKE, and XTEA. Open a terminal and type: Terminal Command: sudo apt-get install mcrypt -y 2. Once mcrypt is installed, we'll set a custom right click action in our file manager to make encryption of files super easy. Open up your home folder, click on Edit, Configure custom actions. 3. Click the plus + button on the right and enter in the following information, in the Command box type in: x-terminal-emulator -t \"Encrypt file...\" -e \"mcrypt %f\" Click on Appearance Conditions tab and tick every box except Directories. 4. Go back to the Basic tab and click on the No icon button and browse to Status Icons, and select the changes-prevent-symbolic icon and click on Ok, then Ok on the next box. Your Custom Actions box should now look like this: 5. Now we need to set up the Decrypt option. Repeat step 3 only this time enter in the following information, in the Command box type in: x-terminal-emulator -t \"Decrypt file...\" -e \"mcrypt -d %f\" Click on Appearance Conditions tab and only tick the Other Files box, leave the rest unticked. 6. Repeat step 4 only this time select the changes-allow-symbolic icon. The click on Ok, then Ok on the next box. 7. Your Custom Actions box should now look like this: 8. Click on the Close button on the Custom Actions box. Now we're ready to encrypt a file (only files can be encrypted with this method, not folders) 9. Right click on a file and select Encrypt file. 10. A window will pop up asking you to type in a password, it will then ask you to enter the same password again. Choose a good strong password, a mixture of letters, numbers and characters that you can easily remember. You can now delete the unencrypted file permanently. Here you will see we have a new file with the letters '.nc' attached to the end of it signifying that the file is now encrypted. 11. To decrypt the file later, right click on the file and select Decrypt file. 12. A window will pop up asking you to type in a password. Enter the password you created in step 10. As you can see our file is decrypted and ready to view. If you make any changes to the decrypted file, you need to delete the existing encrypted file and re-encypt the changed file. Top of page Creating and Extracting compressed files Sometimes we may have a collection of pictures to send someone over email. Good practice is to compress these files so that the overall size is much less. The following is an example of how to compress files. Linux Lite supports creation and extraction of these archive file types using the Archive Manager program: .zip .rar .tar .tar.gz .tar.bz2 .7z Archive files can be created/extracted through the right-click menu in the file manager, or by going to Menu, Accessories, Archive Manager and selecting files to archive or extract from there. Creating a compressed file From within the file manager, right-click on any file or folder and select Create Archive. The following example will use a file named example.txt A new window will pop up. From here, type in the Filename, eg. example. Use the drop-down box next to the filename to select the .tar.gz extension as the archive type. Choose a location to save the file in, then click on the Create button. We now have a file called example.tar.gz Compressing multiple files Best practice here is to place all the files you want to compress into a folder. In this example we have a folder called example and inside 3 files. Go back to your home folder and right click on the folder containing the files you wish to compress. Right click the folder and select Create Archive. A new window will pop up. From here, type in the Filename of the file (eg. example) and select zip for the archive type extension. Choose a location for the file, then click the Create button. We now have a zip file called example.tar.gz Extracting compressed files Right click on the compressed file and select Extract Here We how have a folder called example, with our 3 files inside of it. Using Archive Manager from the Menu to create a compressed file. Go to Menu, Accessories, Archive Manager. Drag and drop from your file manager into Archive Manager the folder or files you want to compress. Now click on the Create Archive button. Give the compressed file a name eg. example then click on the Save button. Here is our newly created zip file in Archive Manager. Close that window. Here is our newly created zip file. Top of page Changing Desktop Environments This distro is a heavily modified version of the XFCE desktop environment. However, being GNU/Linux based allows people the freedom to modify their system as they see fit. There are numerous desktop environments in GNU/Linux. Including but not limited to: Budgie Cinnamon Enlightenment Gnome KDE Lumina LXDE LXQT Mate Pantheon Razor-qt Trinity If you desire to install another desktop environment, we cannot provide specific instructions on how to do this. There are far too many variables involved and much can go wrong. This kind of system modification is best left to experienced Linux users. The whole philosophy behind Linux Lite is to provide new users to a Linux based operating system, an easy to use, functional desktop experience. Our support time is better spent dedicated to helping existing Linux Lite users on the XFCE desktop.

The vast majority of programs that you may want/need to install are all centrally located in what are called software repositories (repos). Rather than searching the web, downloading programs from various sites (some of which may not be reliable), running the installer, rebooting, etc., available software is all centrally located and available for installation in seconds. The packages/(programs) in the repositories are tested, approved for inclusion in the repos and securely signed to insure their validity. There are a few common methods for installing and removing software. Linux Lite comes with Lite Software and Package Manager (Synaptic Package Manager) applications. When the program you want is not listed in Lite Software and you already know its name, Package Manager (Synaptic Package Manager) makes installing easy. IMPORTANT: Before you run Package Manager for the first time, read this first. Then come back to here to learn how to install and remove software. Installing Software 1. Click on Menu, System, Package Manager and enter your password when prompted. 2. Make sure All is selected in the left pane and in the Quick Filter or spy glass: type in your search query. In this example we will search for the 'audacious' music player. 3. Double click on the package you want to install. 4. Some software will ask you to Mark additional required changes? These are also known as dependencies and are required for the program to function properly. 5. Click on Mark. Now hit the Apply button on the Synaptic toolbar. The software will install and a Menu entry will be created in the relevant Menu category. For audacious the Menu category would be Multimedia. 6. Go to the Menu and your new software will be there under the relative Category. An alternative way to find your new software is to click on Menu, Accessories, Application Finder. Type your program name in the Search box and the result will display on the right. Double click on the program name and it will launch for you. Uninstalling Software 1. Uninstalling software is the reverse process of installing software in Package Manager (Synaptic Package Manager). Type the name of the software into the Quick Filter or the spy glass box: 2. Right click on the software and select Mark for Removal. Now hit the Apply button on the Synaptic toolbar and your software will uninstall. Be very careful with this process as you can inadvertently uninstall crucial system software. If you have any doubts, please search the net first to see if it is safe to uninstall the software. Synaptic is pretty good at warning you should there be any potential problems. Top of page Installing Software - From Source Code There will be times when you need to compile and install an application or driver from source code. Here's what you do. In this example, we'll install an application (Pidgin) from source code. Most source code packages will come in a compressed archive format. Let's right click on the archive and select Extract Here. We'll go into the newly extracted folder, right click, Open Terminal Here and enter the following command: Terminal Command: ./configure It will now go through and make sure we have all the tools we need to compile this software.. As we can see from below, it needs some software called intltool. Lets go ahead and install that with apt-get. Now that our required package is installed, we can try to ./configure again. TIP: Search the error messages in Google, they should lead you to the package that you need to install. Keep working through the information in the Terminal until ./configure works properly. At last, a successful ./configure. Now we can compile the actual application with the make command. Terminal Command: make This process can take quite a while, so let it run it's course. The make command has completed without errors. Now to install the application. Here we use the sudo make install command. Enter your password when prompted: Terminal Command: sudo make install Once our program has installed, we can run the application command (pidgin) from the Terminal. Note that we place a space and the & symbol at the end. This is so that we can still run the application and close the Terminal. Our application in action. To Uninstall an application from Source Code: Open a Terminal from inside the source code folder of the application you want to remove and enter the following command: Terminal Command: sudo make uninstall Enter your password. Application successfully removed. Top of page Installing Software - From a Deb Package There may be applications that can only be installed via a deb package. Let's show you how to do this. In this example, we'll install Teamviewer. Once we have our deb package downloaded, right click on it and select Open With GDebi Package Installer. Enter your password. A new Package Installer window will pop up. Click on Install Package. The package installer will download any dependencies that application needs and will install the application. The deb package has been installed. Keep the original package incase you ever want to uninstall it. To Uninstall an application from a Deb Package: Double click on the original package, enter your password. Choose Remove Package. If you don't have the package anymore, open a terminal and enter the application name with the removal command: Terminal Command: sudo dpkg -r teamviewer Enter your password. The application has been removed. Top of page Installing Software - From a Terminal using APT Another way to install and remove software, is from the Terminal using the APT (Advanced Package Tool) system. From Wikipedia - 'APT, is a free-software user interface that works with core libraries to handle the installation and removal of software on Debian, Ubuntu, and related Linux distributions.' like Linux Lite. In the following examples, we'll use APT to install, remove, manage and get information from the software known as Ristretto (in most cases). Installing Software. 1. Open a Terminal and type the following, followed by your password. Terminal Command: sudo apt update This command ensures we are getting the latest versions of all software from within that repository. 2. Now, type in the following to install Ristretto: (all package/software names are always in lower-case) Terminal Command: sudo apt install ristretto Removing Software. 1. Open a Terminal and type the following, followed by your password. Then press the Enter key to confirm the removal process. Terminal Command: sudo apt remove ristretto Remove an installed package and all of its dependencies: Terminal Command: sudo apt autoremove ristretto Other useful APT commands. Install more than one program. Leave a space in between program names: Terminal Command: sudo apt install ristretto midori Remove more than one program. Leave a space in between program names: Terminal Command: sudo apt remove ristretto midori This command will remove the program and all of its configuration files. Useful if you don't want any left over files. Terminal Command: sudo apt purge ristretto Update all of your system software from the repositories (specific to Linux Lite):: Terminal Command: sudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade Whenever you install a program, its package is downloaded to a folder. Over time, this folder will grow in size, use this command to empty that folder: Terminal Command: sudo apt clean This command will also remove any unneeded packages associated with an apt remove command when you have removed a specific program.

Top of page Wine - Run Windows programs Wine application is a compatibility layer capable of running many Windows programs in Linux. Software programs are designed for different operating systems, and most won't work on systems that they weren't designed for. Windows programs won't natively run in Linux because they contain instructions that the system can't understand until they're translated by the Windows environment. In that same way, Linux programs won't run under the Windows operating system because Windows is unable to interpret all of their instructions. Through Wine's compatibility layer, when a Windows program tries to perform a function that Linux doesn't normally understand, Wine will translate that program's instruction into one supported by Linux.

Used periodically it can do things like clean out various cached files, empty the trash, remove old kernels from the system if new ones are installed, remove old dependency packages no longer needed and more, freeing up additional space in your hard drive. NOTE: For the duration that you have Lite Tweaks open, you will be asked for your password only once when you perform Administrative tasks. Lite Tweaks can be found under Menu, Settings, Lite Tweaks. Once opened, the Lite Tweaks window features multiple tasks, alphabetically organized by their Name by default. The Description column provides information related to the task(s) to be performed. Users can select either a single or multiple tasks for execution. They will be executed in sequential order until every selected task has been completed. Simply select the tasks you want to complete and click on Begin. Some of the tasks in Lite Tweaks require administrative privileges for execution, hence you will be prompted for your password when needed. Another example, let's use Lite Tweaks kernel cleaner to remove an old linux kernel. Select Kernel Removal, then click on Begin. Enter your password if requested to. The kernel cleaner will only display the kernels that are not currently in use. To remove a kernel, make sure to select the \"image\" and \"header\" files that correspond to the version number of the kernel, then click Remove. A confirmation box will pop-up. Click Yes if you are sure you want to proceed with the kernel removal. Your kernel(s) will then be removed. (This may take a few minutes.) Upon completion, click OK to close the window. When selected tasks have completed, you'll be returned to the Lite Tweaks main window. Top of page Lite Tweaks - Bootup Fix Bootup Fix is used to restore the Linux Lite splash screen (screen shown while booting up Linux Lite) if it ever gets overwritten with the Ubuntu splash by a system update or otherwise. This task requires administrative privileges for execution. Top of page Lite Tweaks - Clear Memory Clear Memory will clear the PageCache, dentries and inodes in your system. The Linux Kernel uses some of your system memory for caching and buffering. Linux is designed in such a way that it looks into the cache before looking onto the hard disk. If it finds the resource in the cache, then the request doesn’t reach the disk, which in turn helps speeding things up. When you clean the cache, the disk cache will be less useful as the operating system will look for the requested resource in the hard drive. Moreover, it will also slow the system for a few seconds while the cache is cleaned and every resource required by the OS is loaded again\tas needed. You should not need to manually clear memory in your system as a general rule; but Lite Tweaks provides an easy way to do so without having to reboot the computer. Top of page Lite Tweaks - Default Web Browser Default Web Browser is a user preference tweak used to, as its name implies, set the user preferred web browser in Linux Lite. Currently, it recognizes and offers support for the following browsers: While XFCE provides a way to set the preferred application for various services (see Menu, Settings, Preferred Applications), not all applications will follow the default browser setting when multiple browsers are installed in the system and not all browsers are recognized by the Preferred Applications program. Therefore, Lite Tweaks provides the means to overcome this inconvenience ensuring that all internet links will be handled by the user defined browser when Default Web Browser tweak is used. To set your default browser, open Menu, Settings, Lite Tweaks, select Default Web Browser from the list and click on Begin. If you have more than one browser installed in your system and notice that not all applications are following your default browser preference setting, Default Web Browser tweak will help you address it. Top of page Lite Tweaks - Hibernate, Suspend Hibernate, Suspend is a user preference tweak used to show or hide the Hibernate, Suspend, Hybrid Sleep and Switch User buttons on the Logout screen. By default, all Log Out options are displayed in Linux Lite's Logout screen. Some PCs do not properly support Hibernate or Suspend in Linux and a user could unintentionally click one of these Logout options while on the Logout screen. It could otherwise be just a personal preference; users who do not hibernate or suspend the computer may not want these buttons on the logout screen. Lite Tweaks provides a way to hide them if desired. Select an option, then click on the Apply Action button.. You will need to reboot your computer for the changes to take affect. Hibernate and Suspend buttons disabled. Hibernate, Suspend, Hybrid Sleep and Switch User buttons disabled. Top of page Updates Notifications Updates Notifications can be set to a variety of suitable intervals. An updates check will run in the background and display an onscreen notification when there are updates available for your computer. To begin, right click on the updates icon in your tray and select Preferences. Select your preferred updates frequency. The default is twice a day. Click on Close. To disable updates notifications, click on Menu, Settings, Session and Startup, Application Autostart tab and untick Package Update Indicator. To enable updates notifications, click on Menu, Settings, Session and Startup, Application Autostart tab and place a tick in Package Update Indicator. Updates Notifications will check for new updates on schedule as defined by the user. If no new updates are available since the last time updates were installed in the system, there will be no new notifications until new updates become available. Top of page Adding a PPA A PPA is a repository containing one or more applications. These are often set up for new software programs or updated versions of some applications. To add a new PPA to your system, follow the guide below. NOTE: You must ensure that the PPA you are adding, is currently supported by the version of Linux Lite you are using. Only use the following PPAs in Linux Lite. If the following PPAs are not displayed, then you cannot use them. If you try to use PPAs that are not supported, you will not be able to receive important system Updates. - Jammy: Linux Lite 6.x Series (fluorite) - Focal: Linux Lite 5.x Series (emerald) - Bionic: Linux Lite 4.x Series (diamond) - Xenial: Linux Lite 3.x Series (citrine) - Trusty: Linux Lite 2.x Series (beryl) Click on Menu and type in software in the search box. The top result should be Software & Updates. Example: For this PPA, Trusty, Xenial, Bionic and Focal are supported, therefore this PPA is compatible with Linux Lite versions: 2x, 3x. 4x and 5x. If Trusty, Xenial, Bionic and Focal were not listed, you would not be able to use this PPA. In the following example, we are going to add the Simple Screen Recorder PPA. With Software & Updates open, click on the Add button and copy and paste from the web page, the ppa address of: ppa:maarten-baert/simplescreenrecorder. Now click on the Add Source button. To finish, click on Close. You'll be prompted to put in your password. Click on the Reload button, the new source will be added to updates, and your new PPA will be loaded. Now got to Menu, System, Package Manager and search for your application in the Search box, in this example simplescreenrecorder. Now double click on it to install the program. Click on the Apply button at the top of the window, and follow the on screen instructions. Your new PPA application is now installed. Top of page Removing a PPA If for some reason we want to remove a PPA, here's how to do it. Your removing a PPA because you no longer need or wish to run a particular piece of software, so be sure to uninstall that software before removing the PPA that is associated with it. Instructions on uninstalling software can be found here. 1. Click on the Menu, and type in software. Click on Software & Updates. 2. Click on the Other Software tab. Select the PPA you wish to remove, be sure to select the PPA that has the ticked box next to it only, then click on the Remove button. Enter your password. 3. Click on the Close button in the next dialogue box and you'll then be asked to reload your sources. Enter your password if requested to. Click on Reload. 4. The PPA removal process is now complete. Top of page File Encryption In todays world, security of your personal files is important. Whether your transporting documents on a USB drive or emailing sensitive information to a friend, colleague or company, encryption is a necessary security measure. 1. First we need to install the encryption software, in this example we'll use mcrypt. Encryption algorithms include DES, Blowfish, ARCFOUR, Enigma, GOST, LOKI97, RC2, Serpent, Threeway, Twofish, WAKE, and XTEA. Open a terminal and type: Terminal Command: sudo apt-get install mcrypt -y 2. Once mcrypt is installed, we'll set a custom right click action in our file manager to make encryption of files super easy. Open up your home folder, click on Edit, Configure custom actions. 3. Click the plus + button on the right and enter in the following information, in the Command box type in: x-terminal-emulator -t \"Encrypt file...\" -e \"mcrypt %f\" Click on Appearance Conditions tab and tick every box except Directories. 4. Go back to the Basic tab and click on the No icon button and browse to Status Icons, and select the changes-prevent-symbolic icon and click on Ok, then Ok on the next box. Your Custom Actions box should now look like this: 5. Now we need to set up the Decrypt option. Repeat step 3 only this time enter in the following information, in the Command box type in: x-terminal-emulator -t \"Decrypt file...\" -e \"mcrypt -d %f\" Click on Appearance Conditions tab and only tick the Other Files box, leave the rest unticked. 6. Repeat step 4 only this time select the changes-allow-symbolic icon. The click on Ok, then Ok on the next box. 7. Your Custom Actions box should now look like this: 8. Click on the Close button on the Custom Actions box. Now we're ready to encrypt a file (only files can be encrypted with this method, not folders) 9. Right click on a file and select Encrypt file. 10. A window will pop up asking you to type in a password, it will then ask you to enter the same password again. Choose a good strong password, a mixture of letters, numbers and characters that you can easily remember. You can now delete the unencrypted file permanently. Here you will see we have a new file with the letters '.nc' attached to the end of it signifying that the file is now encrypted. 11. To decrypt the file later, right click on the file and select Decrypt file. 12. A window will pop up asking you to type in a password. Enter the password you created in step 10. As you can see our file is decrypted and ready to view. If you make any changes to the decrypted file, you need to delete the existing encrypted file and re-encypt the changed file. Top of page Creating and Extracting compressed files Sometimes we may have a collection of pictures to send someone over email. Good practice is to compress these files so that the overall size is much less. The following is an example of how to compress files. Linux Lite supports creation and extraction of these archive file types using the Archive Manager program: .zip .rar .tar .tar.gz .tar.bz2 .7z Archive files can be created/extracted through the right-click menu in the file manager, or by going to Menu, Accessories, Archive Manager and selecting files to archive or extract from there. Creating a compressed file From within the file manager, right-click on any file or folder and select Create Archive. The following example will use a file named example.txt A new window will pop up. From here, type in the Filename, eg. example. Use the drop-down box next to the filename to select the .tar.gz extension as the archive type. Choose a location to save the file in, then click on the Create button. We now have a file called example.tar.gz Compressing multiple files Best practice here is to place all the files you want to compress into a folder. In this example we have a folder called example and inside 3 files. Go back to your home folder and right click on the folder containing the files you wish to compress. Right click the folder and select Create Archive. A new window will pop up. From here, type in the Filename of the file (eg. example) and select zip for the archive type extension. Choose a location for the file, then click the Create button. We now have a zip file called example.tar.gz Extracting compressed files Right click on the compressed file and select Extract Here We how have a folder called example, with our 3 files inside of it. Using Archive Manager from the Menu to create a compressed file. Go to Menu, Accessories, Archive Manager. Drag and drop from your file manager into Archive Manager the folder or files you want to compress. Now click on the Create Archive button. Give the compressed file a name eg. example then click on the Save button. Here is our newly created zip file in Archive Manager. Close that window. Here is our newly created zip file. Top of page Changing Desktop Environments This distro is a heavily modified version of the XFCE desktop environment. However, being GNU/Linux based allows people the freedom to modify their system as they see fit. There are numerous desktop environments in GNU/Linux. Including but not limited to: Budgie Cinnamon Enlightenment Gnome KDE Lumina LXDE LXQT Mate Pantheon Razor-qt Trinity If you desire to install another desktop environment, we cannot provide specific instructions on how to do this. There are far too many variables involved and much can go wrong. This kind of system modification is best left to experienced Linux users. The whole philosophy behind Linux Lite is to provide new users to a Linux based operating system, an easy to use, functional desktop experience. Our support time is better spent dedicated to helping existing Linux Lite users on the XFCE desktop.

The vast majority of programs that you may want/need to install are all centrally located in what are called software repositories (repos). Rather than searching the web, downloading programs from various sites (some of which may not be reliable), running the installer, rebooting, etc., available software is all centrally located and available for installation in seconds. The packages/(programs) in the repositories are tested, approved for inclusion in the repos and securely signed to insure their validity. There are a few common methods for installing and removing software. Linux Lite comes with Lite Software and Package Manager (Synaptic Package Manager) applications. When the program you want is not listed in Lite Software and you already know its name, Package Manager (Synaptic Package Manager) makes installing easy. IMPORTANT: Before you run Package Manager for the first time, read this first. Then come back to here to learn how to install and remove software. Installing Software 1. Click on Menu, System, Package Manager and enter your password when prompted. 2. Make sure All is selected in the left pane and in the Quick Filter or spy glass: type in your search query. In this example we will search for the 'audacious' music player. 3. Double click on the package you want to install. 4. Some software will ask you to Mark additional required changes? These are also known as dependencies and are required for the program to function properly. 5. Click on Mark. Now hit the Apply button on the Synaptic toolbar. The software will install and a Menu entry will be created in the relevant Menu category. For audacious the Menu category would be Multimedia. 6. Go to the Menu and your new software will be there under the relative Category. An alternative way to find your new software is to click on Menu, Accessories, Application Finder. Type your program name in the Search box and the result will display on the right. Double click on the program name and it will launch for you. Uninstalling Software 1. Uninstalling software is the reverse process of installing software in Package Manager (Synaptic Package Manager). Type the name of the software into the Quick Filter or the spy glass box: 2. Right click on the software and select Mark for Removal. Now hit the Apply button on the Synaptic toolbar and your software will uninstall. Be very careful with this process as you can inadvertently uninstall crucial system software. If you have any doubts, please search the net first to see if it is safe to uninstall the software. Synaptic is pretty good at warning you should there be any potential problems. Top of page Installing Software - From Source Code There will be times when you need to compile and install an application or driver from source code. Here's what you do. In this example, we'll install an application (Pidgin) from source code. Most source code packages will come in a compressed archive format. Let's right click on the archive and select Extract Here. We'll go into the newly extracted folder, right click, Open Terminal Here and enter the following command: Terminal Command: ./configure It will now go through and make sure we have all the tools we need to compile this software.. As we can see from below, it needs some software called intltool. Lets go ahead and install that with apt-get. Now that our required package is installed, we can try to ./configure again. TIP: Search the error messages in Google, they should lead you to the package that you need to install. Keep working through the information in the Terminal until ./configure works properly. At last, a successful ./configure. Now we can compile the actual application with the make command. Terminal Command: make This process can take quite a while, so let it run it's course. The make command has completed without errors. Now to install the application. Here we use the sudo make install command. Enter your password when prompted: Terminal Command: sudo make install Once our program has installed, we can run the application command (pidgin) from the Terminal. Note that we place a space and the & symbol at the end. This is so that we can still run the application and close the Terminal. Our application in action. To Uninstall an application from Source Code: Open a Terminal from inside the source code folder of the application you want to remove and enter the following command: Terminal Command: sudo make uninstall Enter your password. Application successfully removed. Top of page Installing Software - From a Deb Package There may be applications that can only be installed via a deb package. Let's show you how to do this. In this example, we'll install Teamviewer. Once we have our deb package downloaded, right click on it and select Open With GDebi Package Installer. Enter your password. A new Package Installer window will pop up. Click on Install Package. The package installer will download any dependencies that application needs and will install the application. The deb package has been installed. Keep the original package incase you ever want to uninstall it. To Uninstall an application from a Deb Package: Double click on the original package, enter your password. Choose Remove Package. If you don't have the package anymore, open a terminal and enter the application name with the removal command: Terminal Command: sudo dpkg -r teamviewer Enter your password. The application has been removed. Top of page Installing Software - From a Terminal using APT Another way to install and remove software, is from the Terminal using the APT (Advanced Package Tool) system. From Wikipedia - 'APT, is a free-software user interface that works with core libraries to handle the installation and removal of software on Debian, Ubuntu, and related Linux distributions.' like Linux Lite. In the following examples, we'll use APT to install, remove, manage and get information from the software known as Ristretto (in most cases). Installing Software. 1. Open a Terminal and type the following, followed by your password. Terminal Command: sudo apt update This command ensures we are getting the latest versions of all software from within that repository. 2. Now, type in the following to install Ristretto: (all package/software names are always in lower-case) Terminal Command: sudo apt install ristretto Removing Software. 1. Open a Terminal and type the following, followed by your password. Then press the Enter key to confirm the removal process. Terminal Command: sudo apt remove ristretto Remove an installed package and all of its dependencies: Terminal Command: sudo apt autoremove ristretto Other useful APT commands. Install more than one program. Leave a space in between program names: Terminal Command: sudo apt install ristretto midori Remove more than one program. Leave a space in between program names: Terminal Command: sudo apt remove ristretto midori This command will remove the program and all of its configuration files. Useful if you don't want any left over files. Terminal Command: sudo apt purge ristretto Update all of your system software from the repositories (specific to Linux Lite):: Terminal Command: sudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade Whenever you install a program, its package is downloaded to a folder. Over time, this folder will grow in size, use this command to empty that folder: Terminal Command: sudo apt clean This command will also remove any unneeded packages associated with an apt remove command when you have removed a specific program. It will also remove unused kernels: Terminal Command: sudo apt autoremove To search for a specific piece of software and get its description: Terminal Command: apt-cache search ristretto To list all packages containing a particular name: Terminal Command: apt-cache pkgnames leaf For a more thorough explanation of a package and its details: Terminal Command: apt-cache show ristretto To list what extra packages (dependencies) are going to be installed with a piece of software: Terminal Command: apt-cache showpkg ristretto How to install a piece of software without it ever being upgraded: Terminal Command: sudo apt install ristretto --no-upgrade How to upgrade only specific pieces of software: Terminal Command: sudo apt install ristretto --only-upgrade How to download a piece of software: Terminal Command: apt download ristretto View the changes in a package since last release: Terminal Command: apt changelog ristretto Top of page Updates Keeping Linux Lite up to date is a simple process. At the top of Menu, Favorites, you will see Install Updates. We've made the update process as simple as possible. Simply click on Install Updates and you will be asked for your password. The program will then search for updates and if it finds any it will ask you if you want to continue. (Note: The update process updates all software on the system that came from the repos.

Top of page Wine - Run Windows programs Wine application is a compatibility layer capable of running many Windows programs in Linux. Software programs are designed for different operating systems, and most won't work on systems that they weren't designed for. Windows programs won't natively run in Linux because they contain instructions that the system can't understand until they're translated by the Windows environment. In that same way, Linux programs won't run under the Windows operating system because Windows is unable to interpret all of their instructions. Through Wine's compatibility layer, when a Windows program tries to perform a function that Linux doesn't normally understand, Wine will translate that program's instruction into one supported by Linux.

Used periodically it can do things like clean out various cached files, empty the trash, remove old kernels from the system if new ones are installed, remove old dependency packages no longer needed and more, freeing up additional space in your hard drive. NOTE: For the duration that you have Lite Tweaks open, you will be asked for your password only once when you perform Administrative tasks. Lite Tweaks can be found under Menu, Settings, Lite Tweaks. Once opened, the Lite Tweaks window features multiple tasks, alphabetically organized by their Name by default. The Description column provides information related to the task(s) to be performed. Users can select either a single or multiple tasks for execution. They will be executed in sequential order until every selected task has been completed. Simply select the tasks you want to complete and click on Begin. Some of the tasks in Lite Tweaks require administrative privileges for execution, hence you will be prompted for your password when needed. Another example, let's use Lite Tweaks kernel cleaner to remove an old linux kernel. Select Kernel Removal, then click on Begin. Enter your password if requested to. The kernel cleaner will only display the kernels that are not currently in use. To remove a kernel, make sure to select the \"image\" and \"header\" files that correspond to the version number of the kernel, then click Remove. A confirmation box will pop-up. Click Yes if you are sure you want to proceed with the kernel removal. Your kernel(s) will then be removed. (This may take a few minutes.) Upon completion, click OK to close the window. When selected tasks have completed, you'll be returned to the Lite Tweaks main window. Top of page Lite Tweaks - Bootup Fix Bootup Fix is used to restore the Linux Lite splash screen (screen shown while booting up Linux Lite) if it ever gets overwritten with the Ubuntu splash by a system update or otherwise. This task requires administrative privileges for execution. Top of page Lite Tweaks - Clear Memory Clear Memory will clear the PageCache, dentries and inodes in your system. The Linux Kernel uses some of your system memory for caching and buffering. Linux is designed in such a way that it looks into the cache before looking onto the hard disk. If it finds the resource in the cache, then the request doesn’t reach the disk, which in turn helps speeding things up. When you clean the cache, the disk cache will be less useful as the operating system will look for the requested resource in the hard drive. Moreover, it will also slow the system for a few seconds while the cache is cleaned and every resource required by the OS is loaded again\tas needed. You should not need to manually clear memory in your system as a general rule; but Lite Tweaks provides an easy way to do so without having to reboot the computer. Top of page Lite Tweaks - Default Web Browser Default Web Browser is a user preference tweak used to, as its name implies, set the user preferred web browser in Linux Lite. Currently, it recognizes and offers support for the following browsers: While XFCE provides a way to set the preferred application for various services (see Menu, Settings, Preferred Applications), not all applications will follow the default browser setting when multiple browsers are installed in the system and not all browsers are recognized by the Preferred Applications program. Therefore, Lite Tweaks provides the means to overcome this inconvenience ensuring that all internet links will be handled by the user defined browser when Default Web Browser tweak is used. To set your default browser, open Menu, Settings, Lite Tweaks, select Default Web Browser from the list and click on Begin. If you have more than one browser installed in your system and notice that not all applications are following your default browser preference setting, Default Web Browser tweak will help you address it. Top of page Lite Tweaks - Hibernate, Suspend Hibernate, Suspend is a user preference tweak used to show or hide the Hibernate, Suspend, Hybrid Sleep and Switch User buttons on the Logout screen. By default, all Log Out options are displayed in Linux Lite's Logout screen. Some PCs do not properly support Hibernate or Suspend in Linux and a user could unintentionally click one of these Logout options while on the Logout screen. It could otherwise be just a personal preference; users who do not hibernate or suspend the computer may not want these buttons on the logout screen. Lite Tweaks provides a way to hide them if desired. Select an option, then click on the Apply Action button.. You will need to reboot your computer for the changes to take affect. Hibernate and Suspend buttons disabled. Hibernate, Suspend, Hybrid Sleep and Switch User buttons disabled. Top of page Updates Notifications Updates Notifications can be set to a variety of suitable intervals. An updates check will run in the background and display an onscreen notification when there are updates available for your computer. To begin, right click on the updates icon in your tray and select Preferences. Select your preferred updates frequency. The default is twice a day. Click on Close. To disable updates notifications, click on Menu, Settings, Session and Startup, Application Autostart tab and untick Package Update Indicator. To enable updates notifications, click on Menu, Settings, Session and Startup, Application Autostart tab and place a tick in Package Update Indicator. Updates Notifications will check for new updates on schedule as defined by the user. If no new updates are available since the last time updates were installed in the system, there will be no new notifications until new updates become available. Top of page Adding a PPA A PPA is a repository containing one or more applications. These are often set up for new software programs or updated versions of some applications. To add a new PPA to your system, follow the guide below. NOTE: You must ensure that the PPA you are adding, is currently supported by the version of Linux Lite you are using. Only use the following PPAs in Linux Lite. If the following PPAs are not displayed, then you cannot use them. If you try to use PPAs that are not supported, you will not be able to receive important system Updates. - Jammy: Linux Lite 6.x Series (fluorite) - Focal: Linux Lite 5.x Series (emerald) - Bionic: Linux Lite 4.x Series (diamond) - Xenial: Linux Lite 3.x Series (citrine) - Trusty: Linux Lite 2.x Series (beryl) Click on Menu and type in software in the search box. The top result should be Software & Updates. Example: For this PPA, Trusty, Xenial, Bionic and Focal are supported, therefore this PPA is compatible with Linux Lite versions: 2x, 3x. 4x and 5x. If Trusty, Xenial, Bionic and Focal were not listed, you would not be able to use this PPA. In the following example, we are going to add the Simple Screen Recorder PPA. With Software & Updates open, click on the Add button and copy and paste from the web page, the ppa address of: ppa:maarten-baert/simplescreenrecorder. Now click on the Add Source button. To finish, click on Close. You'll be prompted to put in your password. Click on the Reload button, the new source will be added to updates, and your new PPA will be loaded. Now got to Menu, System, Package Manager and search for your application in the Search box, in this example simplescreenrecorder. Now double click on it to install the program. Click on the Apply button at the top of the window, and follow the on screen instructions. Your new PPA application is now installed. Top of page Removing a PPA If for some reason we want to remove a PPA, here's how to do it. Your removing a PPA because you no longer need or wish to run a particular piece of software, so be sure to uninstall that software before removing the PPA that is associated with it. Instructions on uninstalling software can be found here. 1. Click on the Menu, and type in software. Click on Software & Updates. 2. Click on the Other Software tab. Select the PPA you wish to remove, be sure to select the PPA that has the ticked box next to it only, then click on the Remove button. Enter your password. 3. Click on the Close button in the next dialogue box and you'll then be asked to reload your sources. Enter your password if requested to. Click on Reload. 4. The PPA removal process is now complete. Top of page File Encryption In todays world, security of your personal files is important. Whether your transporting documents on a USB drive or emailing sensitive information to a friend, colleague or company, encryption is a necessary security measure. 1. First we need to install the encryption software, in this example we'll use mcrypt. Encryption algorithms include DES, Blowfish, ARCFOUR, Enigma, GOST, LOKI97, RC2, Serpent, Threeway, Twofish, WAKE, and XTEA. Open a terminal and type: Terminal Command: sudo apt-get install mcrypt -y 2. Once mcrypt is installed, we'll set a custom right click action in our file manager to make encryption of files super easy. Open up your home folder, click on Edit, Configure custom actions. 3. Click the plus + button on the right and enter in the following information, in the Command box type in: x-terminal-emulator -t \"Encrypt file...\" -e \"mcrypt %f\" Click on Appearance Conditions tab and tick every box except Directories. 4. Go back to the Basic tab and click on the No icon button and browse to Status Icons, and select the changes-prevent-symbolic icon and click on Ok, then Ok on the next box. Your Custom Actions box should now look like this: 5. Now we need to set up the Decrypt option. Repeat step 3 only this time enter in the following information, in the Command box type in: x-terminal-emulator -t \"Decrypt file...\" -e \"mcrypt -d %f\" Click on Appearance Conditions tab and only tick the Other Files box, leave the rest unticked. 6. Repeat step 4 only this time select the changes-allow-symbolic icon. The click on Ok, then Ok on the next box. 7. Your Custom Actions box should now look like this: 8. Click on the Close button on the Custom Actions box. Now we're ready to encrypt a file (only files can be encrypted with this method, not folders) 9. Right click on a file and select Encrypt file. 10. A window will pop up asking you to type in a password, it will then ask you to enter the same password again. Choose a good strong password, a mixture of letters, numbers and characters that you can easily remember. You can now delete the unencrypted file permanently. Here you will see we have a new file with the letters '.nc' attached to the end of it signifying that the file is now encrypted. 11. To decrypt the file later, right click on the file and select Decrypt file. 12. A window will pop up asking you to type in a password. Enter the password you created in step 10. As you can see our file is decrypted and ready to view. If you make any changes to the decrypted file, you need to delete the existing encrypted file and re-encypt the changed file. Top of page Creating and Extracting compressed files Sometimes we may have a collection of pictures to send someone over email. Good practice is to compress these files so that the overall size is much less. The following is an example of how to compress files. Linux Lite supports creation and extraction of these archive file types using the Archive Manager program: .zip .rar .tar .tar.gz .tar.bz2 .7z Archive files can be created/extracted through the right-click menu in the file manager, or by going to Menu, Accessories, Archive Manager and selecting files to archive or extract from there. Creating a compressed file From within the file manager, right-click on any file or folder and select Create Archive. The following example will use a file named example.txt A new window will pop up. From here, type in the Filename, eg. example. Use the drop-down box next to the filename to select the .tar.gz extension as the archive type. Choose a location to save the file in, then click on the Create button. We now have a file called example.tar.gz Compressing multiple files Best practice here is to place all the files you want to compress into a folder. In this example we have a folder called example and inside 3 files. Go back to your home folder and right click on the folder containing the files you wish to compress. Right click the folder and select Create Archive. A new window will pop up. From here, type in the Filename of the file (eg. example) and select zip for the archive type extension. Choose a location for the file, then click the Create button. We now have a zip file called example.tar.gz Extracting compressed files Right click on the compressed file and select Extract Here We how have a folder called example, with our 3 files inside of it. Using Archive Manager from the Menu to create a compressed file. Go to Menu, Accessories, Archive Manager. Drag and drop from your file manager into Archive Manager the folder or files you want to compress. Now click on the Create Archive button. Give the compressed file a name eg. example then click on the Save button. Here is our newly created zip file in Archive Manager. Close that window. Here is our newly created zip file. Top of page Changing Desktop Environments This distro is a heavily modified version of the XFCE desktop environment. However, being GNU/Linux based allows people the freedom to modify their system as they see fit. There are numerous desktop environments in GNU/Linux. Including but not limited to: Budgie Cinnamon Enlightenment Gnome KDE Lumina LXDE LXQT Mate Pantheon Razor-qt Trinity If you desire to install another desktop environment, we cannot provide specific instructions on how to do this. There are far too many variables involved and much can go wrong. This kind of system modification is best left to experienced Linux users. The whole philosophy behind Linux Lite is to provide new users to a Linux based operating system, an easy to use, functional desktop experience. Our support time is better spent dedicated to helping existing Linux Lite users on the XFCE desktop.

The vast majority of programs that you may want/need to install are all centrally located in what are called software repositories (repos). Rather than searching the web, downloading programs from various sites (some of which may not be reliable), running the installer, rebooting, etc., available software is all centrally located and available for installation in seconds. The packages/(programs) in the repositories are tested, approved for inclusion in the repos and securely signed to insure their validity. There are a few common methods for installing and removing software. Linux Lite comes with Lite Software and Package Manager (Synaptic Package Manager) applications. When the program you want is not listed in Lite Software and you already know its name, Package Manager (Synaptic Package Manager) makes installing easy. IMPORTANT: Before you run Package Manager for the first time, read this first. Then come back to here to learn how to install and remove software. Installing Software 1. Click on Menu, System, Package Manager and enter your password when prompted. 2. Make sure All is selected in the left pane and in the Quick Filter or spy glass: type in your search query. In this example we will search for the 'audacious' music player. 3. Double click on the package you want to install. 4. Some software will ask you to Mark additional required changes? These are also known as dependencies and are required for the program to function properly. 5. Click on Mark. Now hit the Apply button on the Synaptic toolbar. The software will install and a Menu entry will be created in the relevant Menu category. For audacious the Menu category would be Multimedia. 6. Go to the Menu and your new software will be there under the relative Category. An alternative way to find your new software is to click on Menu, Accessories, Application Finder. Type your program name in the Search box and the result will display on the right. Double click on the program name and it will launch for you. Uninstalling Software 1. Uninstalling software is the reverse process of installing software in Package Manager (Synaptic Package Manager). Type the name of the software into the Quick Filter or the spy glass box: 2. Right click on the software and select Mark for Removal. Now hit the Apply button on the Synaptic toolbar and your software will uninstall. Be very careful with this process as you can inadvertently uninstall crucial system software. If you have any doubts, please search the net first to see if it is safe to uninstall the software. Synaptic is pretty good at warning you should there be any potential problems. Top of page Installing Software - From Source Code There will be times when you need to compile and install an application or driver from source code. Here's what you do. In this example, we'll install an application (Pidgin) from source code. Most source code packages will come in a compressed archive format. Let's right click on the archive and select Extract Here. We'll go into the newly extracted folder, right click, Open Terminal Here and enter the following command: Terminal Command: ./configure It will now go through and make sure we have all the tools we need to compile this software.. As we can see from below, it needs some software called intltool. Lets go ahead and install that with apt-get. Now that our required package is installed, we can try to ./configure again. TIP: Search the error messages in Google, they should lead you to the package that you need to install. Keep working through the information in the Terminal until ./configure works properly. At last, a successful ./configure. Now we can compile the actual application with the make command. Terminal Command: make This process can take quite a while, so let it run it's course. The make command has completed without errors. Now to install the application. Here we use the sudo make install command. Enter your password when prompted: Terminal Command: sudo make install Once our program has installed, we can run the application command (pidgin) from the Terminal. Note that we place a space and the & symbol at the end. This is so that we can still run the application and close the Terminal. Our application in action. To Uninstall an application from Source Code: Open a Terminal from inside the source code folder of the application you want to remove and enter the following command: Terminal Command: sudo make uninstall Enter your password. Application successfully removed. Top of page Installing Software - From a Deb Package There may be applications that can only be installed via a deb package. Let's show you how to do this. In this example, we'll install Teamviewer. Once we have our deb package downloaded, right click on it and select Open With GDebi Package Installer. Enter your password. A new Package Installer window will pop up. Click on Install Package. The package installer will download any dependencies that application needs and will install the application. The deb package has been installed. Keep the original package incase you ever want to uninstall it. To Uninstall an application from a Deb Package: Double click on the original package, enter your password. Choose Remove Package. If you don't have the package anymore, open a terminal and enter the application name with the removal command: Terminal Command: sudo dpkg -r teamviewer Enter your password. The application has been removed. Top of page Installing Software - From a Terminal using APT Another way to install and remove software, is from the Terminal using the APT (Advanced Package Tool) system. From Wikipedia - 'APT, is a free-software user interface that works with core libraries to handle the installation and removal of software on Debian, Ubuntu, and related Linux distributions.' like Linux Lite. In the following examples, we'll use APT to install, remove, manage and get information from the software known as Ristretto (in most cases). Installing Software. 1. Open a Terminal and type the following, followed by your password. Terminal Command: sudo apt update This command ensures we are getting the latest versions of all software from within that repository. 2. Now, type in the following to install Ristretto: (all package/software names are always in lower-case) Terminal Command: sudo apt install ristretto Removing Software. 1. Open a Terminal and type the following, followed by your password. Then press the Enter key to confirm the removal process. Terminal Command: sudo apt remove ristretto Remove an installed package and all of its dependencies: Terminal Command: sudo apt autoremove ristretto Other useful APT commands. Install more than one program. Leave a space in between program names: Terminal Command: sudo apt install ristretto midori Remove more than one program. Leave a space in between program names: Terminal Command: sudo apt remove ristretto midori This command will remove the program and all of its configuration files. Useful if you don't want any left over files. Terminal Command: sudo apt purge ristretto Update all of your system software from the repositories (specific to Linux Lite):: Terminal Command: sudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade Whenever you install a program, its package is downloaded to a folder. Over time, this folder will grow in size, use this command to empty that folder: Terminal Command: sudo apt clean This command will also remove any unneeded packages associated with an apt remove command when you have removed a specific program. It will also remove unused kernels: Terminal Command: sudo apt autoremove To search for a specific piece of software and get its description: Terminal Command: apt-cache search ristretto To list all packages containing a particular name: Terminal Command: apt-cache pkgnames leaf For a more thorough explanation of a package and its details: Terminal Command: apt-cache show ristretto To list what extra packages (dependencies) are going to be installed with a piece of software: Terminal Command: apt-cache showpkg ristretto How to install a piece of software without it ever being upgraded: Terminal Command: sudo apt install ristretto --no-upgrade How to upgrade only specific pieces of software: Terminal Command: sudo apt install ristretto --only-upgrade How to download a piece of software: Terminal Command: apt download ristretto View the changes in a package since last release: Terminal Command: apt changelog ristretto Top of page Updates Keeping Linux Lite up to date is a simple process. At the top of Menu, Favorites, you will see Install Updates. We've made the update process as simple as possible. Simply click on Install Updates and you will be asked for your password. The program will then search for updates and if it finds any it will ask you if you want to continue. (Note: The update process updates all software on the system that came from the repos. Unlike in Windows, there is no need to update individual software programs manually. When you run Install Updates, that will update all packages that have updates available for them.) You can set reminders in Linux Lite to tell you when new updates are available. For more information on this, click here. Top of page Change your Software Updates Country Location To ensure that you get updates and software downloaded as fast as possible, try selecting servers from locations closer to you. In the following tutorial we will show you how to do this. Click on Menu and type in software in the search box. The top result should be Software & Updates. From the Software & Updates window, select Other. From the drop down box, select a new repository under whichever Country you choose, then click on Choose Server. Enter your password. Click on the Close button. The following window will appear. Click on the Reload button. Updates are now refreshing from your new mirror.

Top of page Wine - Run Windows programs Wine application is a compatibility layer capable of running many Windows programs in Linux. Software programs are designed for different operating systems, and most won't work on systems that they weren't designed for. Windows programs won't natively run in Linux because they contain instructions that the system can't understand until they're translated by the Windows environment. In that same way, Linux programs won't run under the Windows operating system because Windows is unable to interpret all of their instructions. Through Wine's compatibility layer, when a Windows program tries to perform a function that Linux doesn't normally understand, Wine will translate that program's instruction into one supported by Linux.

Used periodically it can do things like clean out various cached files, empty the trash, remove old kernels from the system if new ones are installed, remove old dependency packages no longer needed and more, freeing up additional space in your hard drive. NOTE: For the duration that you have Lite Tweaks open, you will be asked for your password only once when you perform Administrative tasks. Lite Tweaks can be found under Menu, Settings, Lite Tweaks. Once opened, the Lite Tweaks window features multiple tasks, alphabetically organized by their Name by default. The Description column provides information related to the task(s) to be performed. Users can select either a single or multiple tasks for execution. They will be executed in sequential order until every selected task has been completed. Simply select the tasks you want to complete and click on Begin. Some of the tasks in Lite Tweaks require administrative privileges for execution, hence you will be prompted for your password when needed. Another example, let's use Lite Tweaks kernel cleaner to remove an old linux kernel. Select Kernel Removal, then click on Begin. Enter your password if requested to. The kernel cleaner will only display the kernels that are not currently in use. To remove a kernel, make sure to select the \"image\" and \"header\" files that correspond to the version number of the kernel, then click Remove. A confirmation box will pop-up. Click Yes if you are sure you want to proceed with the kernel removal. Your kernel(s) will then be removed. (This may take a few minutes.) Upon completion, click OK to close the window. When selected tasks have completed, you'll be returned to the Lite Tweaks main window. Top of page Lite Tweaks - Bootup Fix Bootup Fix is used to restore the Linux Lite splash screen (screen shown while booting up Linux Lite) if it ever gets overwritten with the Ubuntu splash by a system update or otherwise. This task requires administrative privileges for execution. Top of page Lite Tweaks - Clear Memory Clear Memory will clear the PageCache, dentries and inodes in your system. The Linux Kernel uses some of your system memory for caching and buffering. Linux is designed in such a way that it looks into the cache before looking onto the hard disk. If it finds the resource in the cache, then the request doesn’t reach the disk, which in turn helps speeding things up. When you clean the cache, the disk cache will be less useful as the operating system will look for the requested resource in the hard drive. Moreover, it will also slow the system for a few seconds while the cache is cleaned and every resource required by the OS is loaded again\tas needed. You should not need to manually clear memory in your system as a general rule; but Lite Tweaks provides an easy way to do so without having to reboot the computer. Top of page Lite Tweaks - Default Web Browser Default Web Browser is a user preference tweak used to, as its name implies, set the user preferred web browser in Linux Lite. Currently, it recognizes and offers support for the following browsers: While XFCE provides a way to set the preferred application for various services (see Menu, Settings, Preferred Applications), not all applications will follow the default browser setting when multiple browsers are installed in the system and not all browsers are recognized by the Preferred Applications program. Therefore, Lite Tweaks provides the means to overcome this inconvenience ensuring that all internet links will be handled by the user defined browser when Default Web Browser tweak is used. To set your default browser, open Menu, Settings, Lite Tweaks, select Default Web Browser from the list and click on Begin. If you have more than one browser installed in your system and notice that not all applications are following your default browser preference setting, Default Web Browser tweak will help you address it. Top of page Lite Tweaks - Hibernate, Suspend Hibernate, Suspend is a user preference tweak used to show or hide the Hibernate, Suspend, Hybrid Sleep and Switch User buttons on the Logout screen. By default, all Log Out options are displayed in Linux Lite's Logout screen. Some PCs do not properly support Hibernate or Suspend in Linux and a user could unintentionally click one of these Logout options while on the Logout screen. It could otherwise be just a personal preference; users who do not hibernate or suspend the computer may not want these buttons on the logout screen. Lite Tweaks provides a way to hide them if desired. Select an option, then click on the Apply Action button.. You will need to reboot your computer for the changes to take affect. Hibernate and Suspend buttons disabled. Hibernate, Suspend, Hybrid Sleep and Switch User buttons disabled. Top of page Updates Notifications Updates Notifications can be set to a variety of suitable intervals. An updates check will run in the background and display an onscreen notification when there are updates available for your computer. To begin, right click on the updates icon in your tray and select Preferences. Select your preferred updates frequency. The default is twice a day. Click on Close. To disable updates notifications, click on Menu, Settings, Session and Startup, Application Autostart tab and untick Package Update Indicator. To enable updates notifications, click on Menu, Settings, Session and Startup, Application Autostart tab and place a tick in Package Update Indicator. Updates Notifications will check for new updates on schedule as defined by the user. If no new updates are available since the last time updates were installed in the system, there will be no new notifications until new updates become available. Top of page Adding a PPA A PPA is a repository containing one or more applications. These are often set up for new software programs or updated versions of some applications. To add a new PPA to your system, follow the guide below. NOTE: You must ensure that the PPA you are adding, is currently supported by the version of Linux Lite you are using. Only use the following PPAs in Linux Lite. If the following PPAs are not displayed, then you cannot use them. If you try to use PPAs that are not supported, you will not be able to receive important system Updates. - Jammy: Linux Lite 6.x Series (fluorite) - Focal: Linux Lite 5.x Series (emerald) - Bionic: Linux Lite 4.x Series (diamond) - Xenial: Linux Lite 3.x Series (citrine) - Trusty: Linux Lite 2.x Series (beryl) Click on Menu and type in software in the search box. The top result should be Software & Updates. Example: For this PPA, Trusty, Xenial, Bionic and Focal are supported, therefore this PPA is compatible with Linux Lite versions: 2x, 3x. 4x and 5x. If Trusty, Xenial, Bionic and Focal were not listed, you would not be able to use this PPA. In the following example, we are going to add the Simple Screen Recorder PPA. With Software & Updates open, click on the Add button and copy and paste from the web page, the ppa address of: ppa:maarten-baert/simplescreenrecorder. Now click on the Add Source button. To finish, click on Close. You'll be prompted to put in your password. Click on the Reload button, the new source will be added to updates, and your new PPA will be loaded. Now got to Menu, System, Package Manager and search for your application in the Search box, in this example simplescreenrecorder. Now double click on it to install the program. Click on the Apply button at the top of the window, and follow the on screen instructions. Your new PPA application is now installed. Top of page Removing a PPA If for some reason we want to remove a PPA, here's how to do it. Your removing a PPA because you no longer need or wish to run a particular piece of software, so be sure to uninstall that software before removing the PPA that is associated with it. Instructions on uninstalling software can be found here. 1. Click on the Menu, and type in software. Click on Software & Updates. 2. Click on the Other Software tab. Select the PPA you wish to remove, be sure to select the PPA that has the ticked box next to it only, then click on the Remove button. Enter your password. 3. Click on the Close button in the next dialogue box and you'll then be asked to reload your sources. Enter your password if requested to. Click on Reload. 4. The PPA removal process is now complete. Top of page File Encryption In todays world, security of your personal files is important. Whether your transporting documents on a USB drive or emailing sensitive information to a friend, colleague or company, encryption is a necessary security measure. 1. First we need to install the encryption software, in this example we'll use mcrypt. Encryption algorithms include DES, Blowfish, ARCFOUR, Enigma, GOST, LOKI97, RC2, Serpent, Threeway, Twofish, WAKE, and XTEA. Open a terminal and type: Terminal Command: sudo apt-get install mcrypt -y 2. Once mcrypt is installed, we'll set a custom right click action in our file manager to make encryption of files super easy. Open up your home folder, click on Edit, Configure custom actions. 3. Click the plus + button on the right and enter in the following information, in the Command box type in: x-terminal-emulator -t \"Encrypt file...\" -e \"mcrypt %f\" Click on Appearance Conditions tab and tick every box except Directories. 4. Go back to the Basic tab and click on the No icon button and browse to Status Icons, and select the changes-prevent-symbolic icon and click on Ok, then Ok on the next box. Your Custom Actions box should now look like this: 5. Now we need to set up the Decrypt option. Repeat step 3 only this time enter in the following information, in the Command box type in: x-terminal-emulator -t \"Decrypt file...\" -e \"mcrypt -d %f\" Click on Appearance Conditions tab and only tick the Other Files box, leave the rest unticked. 6. Repeat step 4 only this time select the changes-allow-symbolic icon. The click on Ok, then Ok on the next box. 7. Your Custom Actions box should now look like this: 8. Click on the Close button on the Custom Actions box. Now we're ready to encrypt a file (only files can be encrypted with this method, not folders) 9. Right click on a file and select Encrypt file. 10. A window will pop up asking you to type in a password, it will then ask you to enter the same password again. Choose a good strong password, a mixture of letters, numbers and characters that you can easily remember. You can now delete the unencrypted file permanently. Here you will see we have a new file with the letters '.nc' attached to the end of it signifying that the file is now encrypted. 11. To decrypt the file later, right click on the file and select Decrypt file. 12. A window will pop up asking you to type in a password. Enter the password you created in step 10. As you can see our file is decrypted and ready to view. If you make any changes to the decrypted file, you need to delete the existing encrypted file and re-encypt the changed file. Top of page Creating and Extracting compressed files Sometimes we may have a collection of pictures to send someone over email. Good practice is to compress these files so that the overall size is much less. The following is an example of how to compress files. Linux Lite supports creation and extraction of these archive file types using the Archive Manager program: .zip .rar .tar .tar.gz .tar.bz2 .7z Archive files can be created/extracted through the right-click menu in the file manager, or by going to Menu, Accessories, Archive Manager and selecting files to archive or extract from there. Creating a compressed file From within the file manager, right-click on any file or folder and select Create Archive. The following example will use a file named example.txt A new window will pop up. From here, type in the Filename, eg. example. Use the drop-down box next to the filename to select the .tar.gz extension as the archive type. Choose a location to save the file in, then click on the Create button. We now have a file called example.tar.gz Compressing multiple files Best practice here is to place all the files you want to compress into a folder. In this example we have a folder called example and inside 3 files. Go back to your home folder and right click on the folder containing the files you wish to compress. Right click the folder and select Create Archive. A new window will pop up. From here, type in the Filename of the file (eg. example) and select zip for the archive type extension. Choose a location for the file, then click the Create button. We now have a zip file called example.tar.gz Extracting compressed files Right click on the compressed file and select Extract Here We how have a folder called example, with our 3 files inside of it. Using Archive Manager from the Menu to create a compressed file. Go to Menu, Accessories, Archive Manager. Drag and drop from your file manager into Archive Manager the folder or files you want to compress. Now click on the Create Archive button. Give the compressed file a name eg. example then click on the Save button. Here is our newly created zip file in Archive Manager. Close that window. Here is our newly created zip file. Top of page Changing Desktop Environments This distro is a heavily modified version of the XFCE desktop environment. However, being GNU/Linux based allows people the freedom to modify their system as they see fit. There are numerous desktop environments in GNU/Linux. Including but not limited to: Budgie Cinnamon Enlightenment Gnome KDE Lumina LXDE LXQT Mate Pantheon Razor-qt Trinity If you desire to install another desktop environment, we cannot provide specific instructions on how to do this. There are far too many variables involved and much can go wrong. This kind of system modification is best left to experienced Linux users. The whole philosophy behind Linux Lite is to provide new users to a Linux based operating system, an easy to use, functional desktop experience. Our support time is better spent dedicated to helping existing Linux Lite users on the XFCE desktop.

The vast majority of programs that you may want/need to install are all centrally located in what are called software repositories (repos). Rather than searching the web, downloading programs from various sites (some of which may not be reliable), running the installer, rebooting, etc., available software is all centrally located and available for installation in seconds. The packages/(programs) in the repositories are tested, approved for inclusion in the repos and securely signed to insure their validity. There are a few common methods for installing and removing software. Linux Lite comes with Lite Software and Package Manager (Synaptic Package Manager) applications. When the program you want is not listed in Lite Software and you already know its name, Package Manager (Synaptic Package Manager) makes installing easy. IMPORTANT: Before you run Package Manager for the first time, read this first. Then come back to here to learn how to install and remove software. Installing Software 1. Click on Menu, System, Package Manager and enter your password when prompted. 2. Make sure All is selected in the left pane and in the Quick Filter or spy glass: type in your search query. In this example we will search for the 'audacious' music player. 3. Double click on the package you want to install. 4. Some software will ask you to Mark additional required changes? These are also known as dependencies and are required for the program to function properly. 5. Click on Mark. Now hit the Apply button on the Synaptic toolbar. The software will install and a Menu entry will be created in the relevant Menu category. For audacious the Menu category would be Multimedia. 6. Go to the Menu and your new software will be there under the relative Category. An alternative way to find your new software is to click on Menu, Accessories, Application Finder. Type your program name in the Search box and the result will display on the right. Double click on the program name and it will launch for you. Uninstalling Software 1. Uninstalling software is the reverse process of installing software in Package Manager (Synaptic Package Manager). Type the name of the software into the Quick Filter or the spy glass box: 2. Right click on the software and select Mark for Removal. Now hit the Apply button on the Synaptic toolbar and your software will uninstall. Be very careful with this process as you can inadvertently uninstall crucial system software. If you have any doubts, please search the net first to see if it is safe to uninstall the software. Synaptic is pretty good at warning you should there be any potential problems. Top of page Installing Software - From Source Code There will be times when you need to compile and install an application or driver from source code. Here's what you do. In this example, we'll install an application (Pidgin) from source code. Most source code packages will come in a compressed archive format. Let's right click on the archive and select Extract Here. We'll go into the newly extracted folder, right click, Open Terminal Here and enter the following command: Terminal Command: It will now go through and make sure we have all the tools we need to compile this software.. As we can see from below, it needs some software called intltool. Lets go ahead and install that with apt-get. Now that our required package is installed, we can try to ./configure again. TIP: Search the error messages in Google, they should lead you to the package that you need to install. Keep working through the information in the Terminal until ./configure works properly. At last, a successful ./configure. Now we can compile the actual application with the make command. Terminal Command: This process can take quite a while, so let it run it's course. The make command has completed without errors. Now to install the application. Here we use the sudo make install command. Enter your password when prompted: Terminal Command: Once our program has installed, we can run the application command (pidgin) from the Terminal. Note that we place a space and the & symbol at the end. This is so that we can still run the application and close the Terminal. Our application in action. To Uninstall an application from Source Code: Open a Terminal from inside the source code folder of the application you want to remove and enter the following command: Terminal Command: Enter your password. Application successfully removed. Top of page Installing Software - From a Deb Package There may be applications that can only be installed via a deb package. Let's show you how to do this. In this example, we'll install Teamviewer. Once we have our deb package downloaded, right click on it and select Open With GDebi Package Installer. Enter your password. A new Package Installer window will pop up. Click on Install Package. The package installer will download any dependencies that application needs and will install the application. The deb package has been installed. Keep the original package incase you ever want to uninstall it. To Uninstall an application from a Deb Package: Double click on the original package, enter your password. Choose Remove Package. If you don't have the package anymore, open a terminal and enter the application name with the removal command: Terminal Command: Enter your password. The application has been removed. Top of page Installing Software - From a Terminal using APT Another way to install and remove software, is from the Terminal using the APT (Advanced Package Tool) system. From Wikipedia - 'APT, is a free-software user interface that works with core libraries to handle the installation and removal of software on Debian, Ubuntu, and related Linux distributions.' like Linux Lite. In the following examples, we'll use APT to install, remove, manage and get information from the software known as Ristretto (in most cases). Installing Software. 1. Open a Terminal and type the following, followed by your password. Terminal Command: This command ensures we are getting the latest versions of all software from within that repository. 2. Now, type in the following to install Ristretto: (all package/software names are always in lower-case) Terminal Command: Removing Software. 1. Open a Terminal and type the following, followed by your password. Then press the Enter key to confirm the removal process. Terminal Command: Remove an installed package and all of its dependencies: Terminal Command: Other useful APT commands. Install more than one program. Leave a space in between program names: Terminal Command: Remove more than one program. Leave a space in between program names: Terminal Command: This command will remove the program and all of its configuration files. Useful if you don't want any left over files. Terminal Command: Update all of your system software from the repositories (specific to Linux Lite):: Terminal Command: Whenever you install a program, its package is downloaded to a folder. Over time, this folder will grow in size, use this command to empty that folder: Terminal Command: This command will also remove any unneeded packages associated with an apt remove command when you have removed a specific program. It will also remove unused kernels: Terminal Command: To search for a specific piece of software and get its description: Terminal Command: To list all packages containing a particular name: Terminal Command: For a more thorough explanation of a package and its details: Terminal Command: To list what extra packages (dependencies) are going to be installed with a piece of software: Terminal Command: How to install a piece of software without it ever being upgraded: Terminal Command: How to upgrade only specific pieces of software: Terminal Command: How to download a piece of software: Terminal Command: View the changes in a package since last release: Terminal Command: Top of page Updates Keeping Linux Lite up to date is a simple process. At the top of Menu, Favorites, you will see Install Updates. We've made the update process as simple as possible. Simply click on Install Updates and you will be asked for your password. The program will then search for updates and if it finds any it will ask you if you want to continue. (Note: The update process updates all software on the system that came from the repos. Unlike in Windows, there is no need to update individual software programs manually. When you run Install Updates, that will update all packages that have updates available for them.) You can set reminders in Linux Lite to tell you when new updates are available. For more information on this, click here. Top of page Change your Software Updates Country Location To ensure that you get updates and software downloaded as fast as possible, try selecting servers from locations closer to you. In the following tutorial we will show you how to do this. Click on Menu and type in software in the search box. The top result should be Software & Updates. From the Software & Updates window, select Other. From the drop down box, select a new repository under whichever Country you choose, then click on Choose Server. Enter your password. Click on the Close button. The following window will appear. Click on the Reload button. Updates are now refreshing from your new mirror.

Top of page Wine - Run Windows programs Wine application is a compatibility layer capable of running many Windows programs in Linux. Software programs are designed for different operating systems, and most won't work on systems that they weren't designed for. Windows programs won't natively run in Linux because they contain instructions that the system can't understand until they're translated by the Windows environment. In that same way, Linux programs won't run under the Windows operating system because Windows is unable to interpret all of their instructions. Through Wine's compatibility layer, when a Windows program tries to perform a function that Linux doesn't normally understand, Wine will translate that program's instruction into one supported by Linux.

Used periodically it can do things like clean out various cached files, empty the trash, remove old kernels from the system if new ones are installed, remove old dependency packages no longer needed and more, freeing up additional space in your hard drive. NOTE: For the duration that you have Lite Tweaks open, you will be asked for your password only once when you perform Administrative tasks. Lite Tweaks can be found under Menu, Settings, Lite Tweaks. Once opened, the Lite Tweaks window features multiple tasks, alphabetically organized by their Name by default. The Description column provides information related to the task(s) to be performed. Users can select either a single or multiple tasks for execution. They will be executed in sequential order until every selected task has been completed. Simply select the tasks you want to complete and click on Begin. Some of the tasks in Lite Tweaks require administrative privileges for execution, hence you will be prompted for your password when needed. Another example, let's use Lite Tweaks kernel cleaner to remove an old linux kernel. Select Kernel Removal, then click on Begin. Enter your password if requested to. The kernel cleaner will only display the kernels that are not currently in use. To remove a kernel, make sure to select the \"image\" and \"header\" files that correspond to the version number of the kernel, then click Remove. A confirmation box will pop-up. Click Yes if you are sure you want to proceed with the kernel removal. Your kernel(s) will then be removed. (This may take a few minutes.) Upon completion, click OK to close the window. When selected tasks have completed, you'll be returned to the Lite Tweaks main window. Top of page Lite Tweaks - Bootup Fix Bootup Fix is used to restore the Linux Lite splash screen (screen shown while booting up Linux Lite) if it ever gets overwritten with the Ubuntu splash by a system update or otherwise. This task requires administrative privileges for execution. Top of page Lite Tweaks - Clear Memory Clear Memory will clear the PageCache, dentries and inodes in your system. The Linux Kernel uses some of your system memory for caching and buffering. Linux is designed in such a way that it looks into the cache before looking onto the hard disk. If it finds the resource in the cache, then the request doesn’t reach the disk, which in turn helps speeding things up. When you clean the cache, the disk cache will be less useful as the operating system will look for the requested resource in the hard drive. Moreover, it will also slow the system for a few seconds while the cache is cleaned and every resource required by the OS is loaded again\tas needed. You should not need to manually clear memory in your system as a general rule; but Lite Tweaks provides an easy way to do so without having to reboot the computer. Top of page Lite Tweaks - Default Web Browser Default Web Browser is a user preference tweak used to, as its name implies, set the user preferred web browser in Linux Lite. Currently, it recognizes and offers support for the following browsers: While XFCE provides a way to set the preferred application for various services (see Menu, Settings, Preferred Applications), not all applications will follow the default browser setting when multiple browsers are installed in the system and not all browsers are recognized by the Preferred Applications program. Therefore, Lite Tweaks provides the means to overcome this inconvenience ensuring that all internet links will be handled by the user defined browser when Default Web Browser tweak is used. To set your default browser, open Menu, Settings, Lite Tweaks, select Default Web Browser from the list and click on Begin. If you have more than one browser installed in your system and notice that not all applications are following your default browser preference setting, Default Web Browser tweak will help you address it. Top of page Lite Tweaks - Hibernate, Suspend Hibernate, Suspend is a user preference tweak used to show or hide the Hibernate, Suspend, Hybrid Sleep and Switch User buttons on the Logout screen. By default, all Log Out options are displayed in Linux Lite's Logout screen. Some PCs do not properly support Hibernate or Suspend in Linux and a user could unintentionally click one of these Logout options while on the Logout screen. It could otherwise be just a personal preference; users who do not hibernate or suspend the computer may not want these buttons on the logout screen. Lite Tweaks provides a way to hide them if desired. Select an option, then click on the Apply Action button.. You will need to reboot your computer for the changes to take affect. Hibernate and Suspend buttons disabled. Hibernate, Suspend, Hybrid Sleep and Switch User buttons disabled. Top of page Updates Notifications Updates Notifications can be set to a variety of suitable intervals. An updates check will run in the background and display an onscreen notification when there are updates available for your computer. To begin, right click on the updates icon in your tray and select Preferences. Select your preferred updates frequency. The default is twice a day. Click on Close. To disable updates notifications, click on Menu, Settings, Session and Startup, Application Autostart tab and untick Package Update Indicator. To enable updates notifications, click on Menu, Settings, Session and Startup, Application Autostart tab and place a tick in Package Update Indicator. Updates Notifications will check for new updates on schedule as defined by the user. If no new updates are available since the last time updates were installed in the system, there will be no new notifications until new updates become available. Top of page Adding a PPA A PPA is a repository containing one or more applications. These are often set up for new software programs or updated versions of some applications. To add a new PPA to your system, follow the guide below. NOTE: You must ensure that the PPA you are adding, is currently supported by the version of Linux Lite you are using. Only use the following PPAs in Linux Lite. If the following PPAs are not displayed, then you cannot use them. If you try to use PPAs that are not supported, you will not be able to receive important system Updates. - Jammy: Linux Lite 6.x Series (fluorite) - Focal: Linux Lite 5.x Series (emerald) - Bionic: Linux Lite 4.x Series (diamond) - Xenial: Linux Lite 3.x Series (citrine) - Trusty: Linux Lite 2.x Series (beryl) Click on Menu and type in software in the search box. The top result should be Software & Updates. Example: For this PPA, Trusty, Xenial, Bionic and Focal are supported, therefore this PPA is compatible with Linux Lite versions: 2x, 3x. 4x and 5x. If Trusty, Xenial, Bionic and Focal were not listed, you would not be able to use this PPA. In the following example, we are going to add the Simple Screen Recorder PPA. With Software & Updates open, click on the Add button and copy and paste from the web page, the ppa address of: ppa:maarten-baert/simplescreenrecorder. Now click on the Add Source button. To finish, click on Close. You'll be prompted to put in your password. Click on the Reload button, the new source will be added to updates, and your new PPA will be loaded. Now got to Menu, System, Package Manager and search for your application in the Search box, in this example simplescreenrecorder. Now double click on it to install the program. Click on the Apply button at the top of the window, and follow the on screen instructions. Your new PPA application is now installed. Top of page Removing a PPA If for some reason we want to remove a PPA, here's how to do it. Your removing a PPA because you no longer need or wish to run a particular piece of software, so be sure to uninstall that software before removing the PPA that is associated with it. Instructions on uninstalling software can be found here. 1. Click on the Menu, and type in software. Click on Software & Updates. 2. Click on the Other Software tab. Select the PPA you wish to remove, be sure to select the PPA that has the ticked box next to it only, then click on the Remove button. Enter your password. 3. Click on the Close button in the next dialogue box and you'll then be asked to reload your sources. Enter your password if requested to. Click on Reload. 4. The PPA removal process is now complete. Top of page File Encryption In todays world, security of your personal files is important. Whether your transporting documents on a USB drive or emailing sensitive information to a friend, colleague or company, encryption is a necessary security measure. 1. First we need to install the encryption software, in this example we'll use mcrypt. Encryption algorithms include DES, Blowfish, ARCFOUR, Enigma, GOST, LOKI97, RC2, Serpent, Threeway, Twofish, WAKE, and XTEA. Open a terminal and type: Terminal Command: 2. Once mcrypt is installed, we'll set a custom right click action in our file manager to make encryption of files super easy. Open up your home folder, click on Edit, Configure custom actions. 3. Click the plus + button on the right and enter in the following information, in the Command box type in: x-terminal-emulator -t \"Encrypt file...\" -e \"mcrypt %f\" Click on Appearance Conditions tab and tick every box except Directories. 4. Go back to the Basic tab and click on the No icon button and browse to Status Icons, and select the changes-prevent-symbolic icon and click on Ok, then Ok on the next box. Your Custom Actions box should now look like this: 5. Now we need to set up the Decrypt option. Repeat step 3 only this time enter in the following information, in the Command box type in: x-terminal-emulator -t \"Decrypt file...\" -e \"mcrypt -d %f\" Click on Appearance Conditions tab and only tick the Other Files box, leave the rest unticked. 6. Repeat step 4 only this time select the changes-allow-symbolic icon. The click on Ok, then Ok on the next box. 7. Your Custom Actions box should now look like this: 8. Click on the Close button on the Custom Actions box. Now we're ready to encrypt a file (only files can be encrypted with this method, not folders) 9. Right click on a file and select Encrypt file. 10. A window will pop up asking you to type in a password, it will then ask you to enter the same password again. Choose a good strong password, a mixture of letters, numbers and characters that you can easily remember. You can now delete the unencrypted file permanently. Here you will see we have a new file with the letters '.nc' attached to the end of it signifying that the file is now encrypted. 11. To decrypt the file later, right click on the file and select Decrypt file. 12. A window will pop up asking you to type in a password. Enter the password you created in step 10. As you can see our file is decrypted and ready to view. If you make any changes to the decrypted file, you need to delete the existing encrypted file and re-encypt the changed file. Top of page Creating and Extracting compressed files Sometimes we may have a collection of pictures to send someone over email. Good practice is to compress these files so that the overall size is much less. The following is an example of how to compress files. Linux Lite supports creation and extraction of these archive file types using the Archive Manager program: .zip .rar .tar .tar.gz .tar.bz2 .7z Archive files can be created/extracted through the right-click menu in the file manager, or by going to Menu, Accessories, Archive Manager and selecting files to archive or extract from there. Creating a compressed file From within the file manager, right-click on any file or folder and select Create Archive. The following example will use a file named example.txt A new window will pop up. From here, type in the Filename, eg. example. Use the drop-down box next to the filename to select the .tar.gz extension as the archive type. Choose a location to save the file in, then click on the Create button. We now have a file called example.tar.gz Compressing multiple files Best practice here is to place all the files you want to compress into a folder. In this example we have a folder called example and inside 3 files. Go back to your home folder and right click on the folder containing the files you wish to compress. Right click the folder and select Create Archive. A new window will pop up. From here, type in the Filename of the file (eg. example) and select zip for the archive type extension. Choose a location for the file, then click the Create button. We now have a zip file called example.tar.gz Extracting compressed files Right click on the compressed file and select Extract Here We how have a folder called example, with our 3 files inside of it. Using Archive Manager from the Menu to create a compressed file. Go to Menu, Accessories, Archive Manager. Drag and drop from your file manager into Archive Manager the folder or files you want to compress. Now click on the Create Archive button. Give the compressed file a name eg. example then click on the Save button. Here is our newly created zip file in Archive Manager. Close that window. Here is our newly created zip file. Top of page Changing Desktop Environments This distro is a heavily modified version of the XFCE desktop environment. However, being GNU/Linux based allows people the freedom to modify their system as they see fit. There are numerous desktop environments in GNU/Linux. Including but not limited to: If you desire to install another desktop environment, we cannot provide specific instructions on how to do this. There are far too many variables involved and much can go wrong. This kind of system modification is best left to experienced Linux users. The whole philosophy behind Linux Lite is to provide new users to a Linux based operating system, an easy to use, functional desktop experience. Our support time is better spent dedicated to helping existing Linux Lite users on the XFCE desktop. Top of page ","tags":"","url":"software.html"},

Next if you have any wireless, wired, graphics card devices or other hardware devices, click on Menu, Settings, Install Drivers. Please read the information provided very carefully before choosing a suitable driver. It is usually best to choose the recommended driver. You can look through how to connect to the internet by clicking here. More information on drivers can be found here. UEFI According to How-To-Geek, \"The BIOS will soon be dead: Intel has announced plans to completely replace it with UEFI on all their chipsets by 2020. The traditional BIOS still has serious limitations. It can only boot from drives of 2.1 TB or less. 3 TB drives are now common, and a computer with a BIOS can’t boot from them. That limitation is due to the way the BIOS’s Master Boot Record system works. UEFI replaces the traditional BIOS on PCs. There’s no way to switch from BIOS to UEFI on an existing PC.\" How do I know if my computer has UEFI? In Windows Search, type msinfo or msinfo32 and launch the desktop app named System Information. Look for the BIOS Mode item, and if the value for it is UEFI, then you have the UEFI firmware. If it says BIOS Mode Legacy, then that’s the firmware you’re running. Also, in general, UEFI-enabled machines have faster startup and shutdown times as compared to BIOS-Legacy machines. If you bought the computer/motherboard after 2010, chances are you have a UEFI system. If you are still unsure, download the UEFI version as it will also detect and run on a BIOS-Legacy computer. If you have an older, legacy type BIOS computer don't worry, Linux Lite will still detect this and install on your computer. Secure Boot Linux Lite recommends that you disable Secure Boot in your BIOS. This will save you potentially a lot of headaches during the use of your system. Linux Lite will run with Secure Boot enabled, but we highly recommend that you don't. You should be aware that Secure Boot is considered a security feature and was implemented to make it harder for things like ransomware to take hold of your pc. Disable Secure Boot in Windows See the following link for generic instructions on how to disable Secure Boot in Windows (configuration will differ slightly depending on the manufacturer) (Internet connection required to view video) Disabling Secure Boot - Tips There are many ways to do this. One of these should work for your system: - In Windows - Hold down Shift, Click on the Power icon in your Menu, click Restart, keep holding down Shift the whole time. Release Shift key once you reach the Recovery options. Go to Troubleshoot, Advanced Options, UEFI Firmware Settings, Restart. You'll then be in your BIOS, Look for Security, or Advanced or Boot Options and find Secure Boot, disable it. Exit your BIOS by saving settings. - Turn on your PC and access your BIOS menu. You can do this by pressing a key during the bootup sequence, eg. F1, F2, F12, or Esc. Look for the Secure Boot setting, set it to Disabled. Secure Boot is usually in either the Security tab, the Boot tab, or the Authentication tab. Save changes and exit your BIOS. - In Windows - Clicking the gear icon on the Start menu will take you to Settings. In Settings, choose Update & Security. Select Recovery from the left menu and you can see Advanced startup at the right side. Click Restart Now under the Advanced startup option. The comptuer will reboot to the Recovery menu. Select Troubleshoot, Advanced options, UEFI Firmware Settings. Restart. Keyboard Function On some laptops you may have to enable Numlock as it is disabled by default. You could also try FN + Numlock to use your keys, or FN + one of the F keys across the top of your keyboard. This varies from computer to computer. Some examples follow: Fn + F11 (Acer, Toshiba, Samsung) Shift + Num Lock Fn + Num Lock (Sony, Gateway) Fn + F11 + Scroll lock Fn + F8 (HP) Ctrl + F11 Fn + Shift + Num Lock Fn + F4 (Dell) Fn + Nmlk (Lenovo, ASUS) Lite System Report Linux Lite comes with the Lite System Report tool found under Menu, Settings.

Post Installation The first thing you should do after a new install is click on Menu, Favorites, Install Updates. Next if you have any wireless, wired, graphics card devices or other hardware devices, click on Menu, Settings, Install Drivers. Please read the information provided very carefully before choosing a suitable driver. It is usually best to choose the recommended driver. You can look through how to connect to the internet by clicking here. More information on drivers can be found here. UEFI According to How-To-Geek, \"The BIOS will soon be dead: Intel has announced plans to completely replace it with UEFI on all their chipsets by 2020. The traditional BIOS still has serious limitations. It can only boot from drives of 2.1 TB or less. 3 TB drives are now common, and a computer with a BIOS can’t boot from them. That limitation is due to the way the BIOS’s Master Boot Record system works. UEFI replaces the traditional BIOS on PCs. There’s no way to switch from BIOS to UEFI on an existing PC.\" How do I know if my computer has UEFI? In Windows Search, type msinfo or msinfo32 and launch the desktop app named System Information. Look for the BIOS Mode item, and if the value for it is UEFI, then you have the UEFI firmware. If it says BIOS Mode Legacy, then that’s the firmware you’re running. Also, in general, UEFI-enabled machines have faster startup and shutdown times as compared to BIOS-Legacy machines. If you bought the computer/motherboard after 2010, chances are you have a UEFI system. If you are still unsure, download the UEFI version as it will also detect and run on a BIOS-Legacy computer. If you have an older, legacy type BIOS computer don't worry, Linux Lite will still detect this and install on your computer. Secure Boot Linux Lite recommends that you disable Secure Boot in your BIOS. This will save you potentially a lot of headaches during the use of your system. Linux Lite will run with Secure Boot enabled, but we highly recommend that you don't. You should be aware that Secure Boot is considered a security feature and was implemented to make it harder for things like ransomware to take hold of your pc. Disable Secure Boot in Windows See the following link for generic instructions on how to disable Secure Boot in Windows (configuration will differ slightly depending on the manufacturer) (Internet connection required to view video) Disabling Secure Boot - Tips There are many ways to do this. One of these should work for your system: - In Windows - Hold down Shift, Click on the Power icon in your Menu, click Restart, keep holding down Shift the whole time. Release Shift key once you reach the Recovery options. Go to Troubleshoot, Advanced Options, UEFI Firmware Settings, Restart. You'll then be in your BIOS, Look for Security, or Advanced or Boot Options and find Secure Boot, disable it. Exit your BIOS by saving settings. - Turn on your PC and access your BIOS menu. You can do this by pressing a key during the bootup sequence, eg. F1, F2, F12, or Esc. Look for the Secure Boot setting, set it to Disabled. Secure Boot is usually in either the Security tab, the Boot tab, or the Authentication tab. Save changes and exit your BIOS. - In Windows - Clicking the gear icon on the Start menu will take you to Settings. In Settings, choose Update & Security. Select Recovery from the left menu and you can see Advanced startup at the right side. Click Restart Now under the Advanced startup option. The comptuer will reboot to the Recovery menu. Select Troubleshoot, Advanced options, UEFI Firmware Settings. Restart. Keyboard Function On some laptops you may have to enable Numlock as it is disabled by default. You could also try FN + Numlock to use your keys, or FN + one of the F keys across the top of your keyboard. This varies from computer to computer. Some examples follow: Fn + F11 (Acer, Toshiba, Samsung) Shift + Num Lock Fn + Num Lock (Sony, Gateway) Fn + F11 + Scroll lock Fn + F8 (HP) Ctrl + F11 Fn + Shift + Num Lock Fn + F4 (Dell) Fn + Nmlk (Lenovo, ASUS) Lite System Report Linux Lite comes with the Lite System Report tool found under Menu, Settings. This tool helps our Support team more accurately identify any problems you may be having, thus providing you with better service. Click here to learn more about this.

Post Installation The first thing you should do after a new install is click on Menu, Favorites, Install Updates. Next if you have any wireless, wired, graphics card devices or other hardware devices, click on Menu, Settings, Install Drivers. Please read the information provided very carefully before choosing a suitable driver. It is usually best to choose the recommended driver. You can look through how to connect to the internet by clicking here. More information on drivers can be found here. UEFI According to How-To-Geek, \"The BIOS will soon be dead: Intel has announced plans to completely replace it with UEFI on all their chipsets by 2020. The traditional BIOS still has serious limitations. It can only boot from drives of 2.1 TB or less. 3 TB drives are now common, and a computer with a BIOS can’t boot from them. That limitation is due to the way the BIOS’s Master Boot Record system works. UEFI replaces the traditional BIOS on PCs. There’s no way to switch from BIOS to UEFI on an existing PC.\" How do I know if my computer has UEFI? In Windows Search, type msinfo or msinfo32 and launch the desktop app named System Information. Look for the BIOS Mode item, and if the value for it is UEFI, then you have the UEFI firmware. If it says BIOS Mode Legacy, then that’s the firmware you’re running. Also, in general, UEFI-enabled machines have faster startup and shutdown times as compared to BIOS-Legacy machines. If you bought the computer/motherboard after 2010, chances are you have a UEFI system. If you are still unsure, download the UEFI version as it will also detect and run on a BIOS-Legacy computer. If you have an older, legacy type BIOS computer don't worry, Linux Lite will still detect this and install on your computer. Secure Boot Linux Lite recommends that you disable Secure Boot in your BIOS. This will save you potentially a lot of headaches during the use of your system. Linux Lite will run with Secure Boot enabled, but we highly recommend that you don't. You should be aware that Secure Boot is considered a security feature and was implemented to make it harder for things like ransomware to take hold of your pc. Disable Secure Boot in Windows See the following link for generic instructions on how to disable Secure Boot in Windows (configuration will differ slightly depending on the manufacturer) (Internet connection required to view video) Disabling Secure Boot - Tips There are many ways to do this. One of these should work for your system: - In Windows - Hold down Shift, Click on the Power icon in your Menu, click Restart, keep holding down Shift the whole time. Release Shift key once you reach the Recovery options. Go to Troubleshoot, Advanced Options, UEFI Firmware Settings, Restart. You'll then be in your BIOS, Look for Security, or Advanced or Boot Options and find Secure Boot, disable it. Exit your BIOS by saving settings. - Turn on your PC and access your BIOS menu. You can do this by pressing a key during the bootup sequence, eg. F1, F2, F12, or Esc. Look for the Secure Boot setting, set it to Disabled. Secure Boot is usually in either the Security tab, the Boot tab, or the Authentication tab. Save changes and exit your BIOS. - In Windows - Clicking the gear icon on the Start menu will take you to Settings. In Settings, choose Update & Security. Select Recovery from the left menu and you can see Advanced startup at the right side. Click Restart Now under the Advanced startup option. The comptuer will reboot to the Recovery menu. Select Troubleshoot, Advanced options, UEFI Firmware Settings. Restart. Keyboard Function On some laptops you may have to enable Numlock as it is disabled by default. You could also try FN + Numlock to use your keys, or FN + one of the F keys across the top of your keyboard. This varies from computer to computer. Some examples follow: Fn + F11 (Acer, Toshiba, Samsung) Shift + Num Lock Fn + Num Lock (Sony, Gateway) Fn + F11 + Scroll lock Fn + F8 (HP) Ctrl + F11 Fn + Shift + Num Lock Fn + F4 (Dell) Fn + Nmlk (Lenovo, ASUS) Lite System Report Linux Lite comes with the Lite System Report tool found under Menu, Settings.

That limitation is due to the way the BIOS’s Master Boot Record system works. UEFI replaces the traditional BIOS on PCs. There’s no way to switch from BIOS to UEFI on an existing PC.\" How do I know if my computer has UEFI? In Windows Search, type msinfo or msinfo32 and launch the desktop app named System Information. Look for the BIOS Mode item, and if the value for it is UEFI, then you have the UEFI firmware. If it says BIOS Mode Legacy, then that’s the firmware you’re running. Also, in general, UEFI-enabled machines have faster startup and shutdown times as compared to BIOS-Legacy machines. If you bought the computer/motherboard after 2010, chances are you have a UEFI system. If you are still unsure, download the UEFI version as it will also detect and run on a BIOS-Legacy computer. If you have an older, legacy type BIOS computer don't worry, Linux Lite will still detect this and install on your computer. Secure Boot Linux Lite recommends that you disable Secure Boot in your BIOS. This will save you potentially a lot of headaches during the use of your system. Linux Lite will run with Secure Boot enabled, but we highly recommend that you don't. You should be aware that Secure Boot is considered a security feature and was implemented to make it harder for things like ransomware to take hold of your pc. Disable Secure Boot in Windows See the following link for generic instructions on how to disable Secure Boot in Windows (configuration will differ slightly depending on the manufacturer) (Internet connection required to view video) Disabling Secure Boot - Tips There are many ways to do this. One of these should work for your system: Keyboard Function On some laptops you may have to enable Numlock as it is disabled by default. You could also try FN + Numlock to use your keys, or FN + one of the F keys across the top of your keyboard. This varies from computer to computer. Some examples follow: Lite System Report Linux Lite comes with the Lite System Report tool found under Menu, Settings. This tool helps our Support team more accurately identify any problems you may be having, thus providing you with better service. Click here to learn more about this. Lite info The purpose of the Linux Lite Hardware Database, is to give people an idea of different computer configurations from within a Linux Lite Series. The Linux Lite Hardware Database displays Make and Model, CPU, Graphics, Audio, Network and Storage technical specifications. This provides a snapshot of the kind of computers people are able to use with Linux Lite. No personal or security related information is gathered or displayed. Click on Menu, Settings, Lite Info to share your hardware and help others. Click here to go to the Linux Lite Hardware Database.

Let's start the Tour. The Desktop layout 1 - 10 - Taskbar. This area consists of the Menu, quick launch application icons, workspaces and the system tray. 1 - Menu. This is where all of your applications are accessed. In Linux Lite, Menu items are categorized. See here for more information. 2 - Show Desktop. Clicking on this icon minimizes all currently open windows to the taskbar. 3 - Web Browser. Here is where you can launch the web browser Chrome from to allow you to browse your favorite websites on the Internet. 4 - Home Folder. This is where all your Documents, Downloads, Music, Pictures and Videos will be stored. 5 - XFCE Terminal. Otherwise known as the 'command line'. Here, you can run commands just lke you can in Windows (Command Prompt). 6 - Workspaces. These are like virtual desktops. They allow you to run your applications on 2 or more Desktops, increasing your workspace. 7 - Network Icon (system tray). Configure and connect to wired, wireless and VPN networks here. 8 - Install Updates (system tray). Click here to configure and install system updates. 9 - Volume Icon (system tray). You can adjust the main volume level, or if you have several applications running sound, you can adjust each level individually. 10 - Date, Time & Calendar (system tray). Here you can view the date and time, and also view the current months calendar by clicking on the time. 11 - Desktop Icons. Quick and easy access to frequently visited places in your computer (English installations only). Menu Icons 1 - Search Bar. Here you can start typing the name of an application and the Menu will show that application to you in the list. 2 - All Settings. This is the Settings Manager, similar to the Control Panel in Windows. This is where you can adjust things like your Display resolution and Power settings. 3 - Lock Screen. Clicking on this icon will lock your screen. A handy feature to have when you are away from your computer for a short time and want it secured. Enter your password to unlock your screen when you return. 4 - Switch Users. Just like in Windows, if you have more than one user set up and you are both working on the same computer, here you can switch users without needing to login and logout each time. 5 - Logout. Clicking on this icon will bring up a new dialogue window giving you the option to, Log Out, Restart, Shut Down, Suspend or Hibernate your computer. 6 - Login Name. The name of the currently logged in user. 7 - Install Updates. Click here to install the latest updates that help keep your computer safe and secure. See here for more information. 8 - Help Manual. A shortcut to the Linux Lite Help Manual, an excellent resource for learning how to use and configure Linux Lite. Menu Categories In Linux Lite, when you click on the Menu button, applications are stored in the Menu by category. For example, when you navigate to the Office category, you will see all of the Office like applications. Desktop Settings - Changing the Wallpaper When you right click on a clear space on the Desktop, you will get a menu of utilities to select from. To change the Wallpaper, select Desktop Settings from the menu. In the window that appears, left click on any of the wallpapers to set a new Desktop wallpaper. More information on this can be found here. Home Folder The equivalent of Explorer in Windows, is called the Home folder in Linux Lite. This is where all your files get stored. For example, when you download a file from the Internet, that file gets stored in the Downloads folder. The rest of the folders are set up for your convenience in which you can organize your files according to their category. Your music would go into the Music folder, your photos would go into the Pictures folder, and so on. You can store your files directly into your Home folder if you choose to, but keeping files stored in separate folders sure does keep things tidy and easier to find. Settings Manager In Linux Lite, the Settings Manager is like the Control Panel in Windows. This is a central place where you can configure all of your Linux Lite settings. You can access the Settings Manager by going to Menu, Settings, Settings Manager. Top of page Menus The menu system on Linux Lite has been greatly simplified to make navigation intuitive.

Top of page Accessibility - Assistive Technologies Assistive technology (AT) is any item, piece of equipment, software program, or product system that is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of persons with disabilities. AT can be low-tech: communication boards made of cardboard or fuzzy felt. AT can be high-tech: special-purpose computers. AT can be hardware: prosthetics, mounting systems, and positioning devices. AT can be computer hardware: special switches, keyboards, and pointing devices. AT can be computer software: screen readers and communication programs. AT can be inclusive or specialized learning materials and curriculum aids. AT can be specialized curricular software. AT can be much more—electronic devices, wheelchairs, walkers, braces, educational software, power lifts, pencil holders, eye-gaze and head trackers, and much more. Assistive technology helps people who have difficulty speaking, typing, writing, remembering, pointing, seeing, hearing, learning, walking, and many other things. Different disabilities require different assistive technologies. Source - https://www.atia.org/home/at-resources/what-is-at/#what-is-assistive-technology In Linux Lite, we provide a screen reader, a screen magnifier and an onscreen keyboard. The screen reader and the onscreen keyboard can be used on the Login page as shown below. Keyboard Shortcuts: F3 - On Screen Keyboard F4 - Screen Reader Screen Reader - Orca Orca is a free and open-source, flexible, extensible screen reader from the Gnome project for individuals who are blind or visually impaired. Using various combinations of speech synthesis and braille, Orca helps provide access to applications. To start Orca when you Login to your Desktop, click on Menu, Settings, Session and Startup. Then click on the Application Autostart tab, locate Orca Screen Reader and put a tick in the box. Logout, then Login again. To configure Orca to your liking, click on Menu, Settings, Settings Manager. Click on the Orca Settings icon as shown below. Here you can set up your screen reader to your own requirements.

Over time more tutorials will be added to it. Some of them may deal with software that is already included in the standard Linux Lite installation. Many will be for software that needs to be installed first because it is not part of the standard installation. What you will see when installing from Menu, Settings, Lite Software. Lite Software below. Learn how to use it here. What you will see when installing from Menu, System, Package Manager (Synaptic Package Manager). The Synaptic Package Manager below. Learn how to use it here. Top of page AntiVirus Viruses can occur on any computer system. The following tutorial is a collection of commands that allows you to scan your entire system for viruses. Install the virus scanner: Terminal Command: sudo apt-get install clamav clamav-daemon Download the latest virus definitions: Terminal Command: sudo freshclam If you get the following error in your terminal: Terminal: ERROR: /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log is locked by another process Run the following command in your terminal: Terminal: sudo rm -rf /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log Then run the following command again in your terminal: Terminal Command: sudo freshclam Once your virus database is up to date, proceed to scan your system for viruses: Terminal Command: sudo clamscan -r -i / | grep FOUND >> /home/youruser/virus-scan-report.txt Where youruser is your username. The scan will take anywhere from several minutes to several hours, depending on how many files there are to scan. To just scan your home folder, run the following: Terminal Command: clamscan -r -i /home/youruser/ | grep FOUND >> /home/youruser/virus-scan-report.txt Where youruser is your username. When the scan has finished, open the virus-scan-report.txt in your home folder and look to see where any viruses may be residing: You can then go into the folder where the virus was found and delete it. Be sure to run the following command in your terminal before running a new virus scan to ensure your virus definitions are up to date: Terminal Command: sudo freshclam Then run your new virus scan. FireWall A firewall is a piece of software that determines what network traffic can flow between your computer and your local network and internet. By default, the Firewall is disabled in Linux Lite. How a Firewall works: NETWORK TRAFFIC COMING INTO YOUR PC >>> HITS THE FIREWALL >>> FIREWALL SEES IF THERE IS AN EXISTING RULE TO LET THAT TRAFFIC THROUGH. IF THERE IS A RULE, LET IT THROUGH. IF THERE IS NOT A RULE, BLOCK IT. To enable the firewall: Click on Menu, Settings, Settings Manager. Now click on Firewall Config. Enter your password. Click on the Show Status button. Firewall shows as Disabled. Click on the Enable Firewall button. The Firewall will go through the start up process. Click OK to finish. The Firewall now shows as Enabled. The same application can be used to disable the Firewall, just follow the above steps and choose Disable Firewall instead. To enable the firewall in the Terminal: Terminal Command: sudo systemctl unmask --now firewalld Terminal Command: sudo systemctl enable firewalld Terminal Command: sudo systemctl start firewalld The following command shows the status of your firewall: Terminal Command: sudo firewall-cmd --state With the Firewall enabled, Linux Lite let's through the everyday traffic by default, for example, internet and mail. If you want for example to use DropBox, you will need to make sure it has been ticked in the Services tab, and the relevant ports have been added. Torrent applications and their accompanying ports will also need to be ticked and added to function properly. If you have a firewall elsewhere on your network (like most routers do) then you can disable the firewall permanently by doing the following: Terminal Command: sudo systemctl stop firewalld Terminal Command: sudo systemctl disable firewalld Terminal Command: sudo systemctl mask --now firewalld A list of common ports to work with an Enabled Firewall: Teamviewer - 5938 - TCP & UDP NitroShare - 40818 - TCP & 40816 UDP Printing (Network) - 5353 (mDNS) UDP, 631 (IPP/IPPS) TCP, 9100-9102 (AppSocket/JetDirect) - TCP More will be added here over time. Most common firewall applications are included in FirewallD, they just need to be ticked (enabled). Check the existing lists in FirewallD before adding your own rules. You must enable the Firewall by the Terminal first (see above). Click on Menu, Settings, Firewall. Enter your password. Select Configuration, Permanent before you attempt any type of firewall adjustments. Click on Options in the main menu, Change Default Zone. Select home from the pop up box, then click on OK. We're now set up for home firewall configuration. Now that we're all set up, let's show you how to allow ports through to your computer. In the following example, we'll use SSH, a common protocol for remotely connecting to another computer. Adding a port to an EXISTING service Make sure Configuration is set to Permanent and your Zone is set to home or your changes will not stick. Most SSH servers run on port 22 but this also means that is someone is trying to hack you, this is the first port they will try to attack you on. A clever Server Admin would change this port number before letting the SSH server go live. Let's say it gets changed to Port 6860 for this example. Click on the Services tab and select ssh from the left pane. Then click on +Add at the bottom. Enter in the port number, then click on OK. Enter your password. Port 6860 has now been added. The server admin should now remove port 22 by selecting it and clicking on the -Remove button. Click on Options, Reload Firewalld to activate our new firewall rule, enter your password if prompted. Adding a NEW service Make sure Configuration is set to Permanent and your Zone is set to home or your changes will not stick. In this example, we'll set up a fictitious server and port. Let's call it ACME with port numbers 4545 and 4546 (both using the tcp protocol). Click on the Services tab and click the + sign as shown below. Enter in similar details as you would for your application below. ACME is now added to the application list. Now we just need to add the two ports. Click on Add in the Ports tab and enter in the ports. Enter the port numbers. To make it easy here, just add one at a time. Here our application ACME and it's ports number are all set to go. Click on the Services tab and place a tick in ACME. Click on Options, Reload Firewalld to activate our new firewall rule, enter your password if prompted. Our new Firewall rule is now set up to work properly. Top of page Timeshift Timeshift is a system restore tool for Linux. It provides functionality that is quite similar to the System Restore feature in Windows or the Time Machine tool in MacOS. Timeshift protects your system by making incremental snapshots of the file system manually or at regular automated intervals. These snapshots can then be restored at a later point to undo all changes to the system and restore it to the previous state. Snapshots are made using rsync and hard-links and the tool shares common files amongst snapshots in order to save disk space. Now that we have an idea about what Timeshift is, let us take take a detail look at setting up and using this tool. Go to Menu, System, System Restore Utility. Enter your password. Timeshift supports 2 snapshot formats. The first is by using Rsync and the second is by using the in-built features of BTRFS file system that allows snapshots to be created. Most peoples choice will be Rsync unless you chose the BTRFS file system during your Linux Lite installation. Select Rsync and click on the Next button. The next thing to do is select your snapshot location. You can choose to have your snapshots on your local disk or on an external storage device. Wherever you choose, make sure you have at least 100Gb plus of spare storage. An external hard drive is an wise choice. In the following example, sda5 is our backup location, sda1 is our Linux Lite partition. Click on the Next button. Timeshift allows you to create snapshots on hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or on boot basis. So you can select the frequencies you want and the number of snapshots to keep. Click on Finish to complete your setup. Creating a Restore Point Creating a snapshot is simple. Just click on the Create button and your first snapshot will be created. Depending on what should be included or excluded from the snapshots, it will take several minutes for the process to complete. You can add comments to your snapshots so you can have a description of the snapshot. Settings, Filters You can also specify Filters to include or exclude files or directories from the snapshots. Timeshift is designed to protect system files and settings. User data such as documents, pictures and music are excluded by default. This prevents you from overwriting your documents when you restore a snapshot or using all of your storage to backup media (pictures, music, and video) files. We recommend you use the Backups application in the Accessories menu for your home folder backups, and use Timeshift for system backups, the choice is yours. Clicking on the Summary option under Filters will show you what is included and what is not. Restoring a backup Restoring a Backup is as simple as selecting the snapshot you wish to restore and clicking on the Restore button. Next you will select your target device where files will be restored. You will have to specify your root device and whether or not to keep the boot and home files on the root device or on another partition. You then specify the Bootloader Options as to whether or not to reinstall GRUB2, to update or not intramfs and the Grub Menu. Timeshift will then simulate a Restore by performing a 'Dry run'. This takes place to ensure the Restore process runs without error. On the Confirm Actions window click on Next. The next window is a Warning dialogue that gives you a summary of the Restore process. Click on Next. The Restore process begins. This may take some time. ​The snapshot will be applied and then your computer will restart to complete the process. Many thanks to Mohd Sohail of LinuxAndUbuntu.com for help with this tutorial. Top of page USB Persistence USB Persistence enables the user to have a USB device with Linux Lite installed onto it, that can then be rebooted and all the files and settings are still available. The following tutorial will walk you through how to install Linux Lite to a USB device. We will use mkusb to create our persistent USB. First, we install the mkusb PPA. Complete one line at a time. NOTE: Installing this will remove USB Image Writer and USB Stick Formatter. Terminal Command: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mkusb/ppasudo apt install --install-recommends mkusb mkusb-nox usb-pack-efi Launch mkusb, Menu, System, mkusb. Click on Yes for the dialogue box. Enter your password. Click on OK for the next box. Select Install (make a boot device) and click on OK. Select 'Persistent live' - only Debian and Ubuntu and click on OK. Select the Linux Lite ISO image file. Make sure the correct USB device is listed and selected and click on OK. Select msdos from the list and click on OK. You will need to select upefi if you are using one of our UEFI installs on your UEFI computer. Adjust the slider to your preferences or just accept the default persistence space. This is the space where your settings and files will be saved to so make sure to give it adequate space. When you are ready, select Go then click on the Go button. The application will now go ahead and create the USB persistence for you. This may take some time. The process is now complete. Click on all the Quit options. You can now plug your USB device into a computer and boot from it. Top of page VirtualBox The VirtualBox application allows you to run other OS's (operating systems) within your main OS by creating a container of sorts for them to run in, independently from the main OS. You install other OS's to VirtualBox just like you would to a normal hard drive. VirtualBox creates a virtual hard drive for you to install to and the result is referred to as a Virtual Machine (VM). You can install to VirtualBox using a bootable CD or DVD. Even more conveniently, you can install using a downloaded ISO file without the need to burn it first to a CD/DVD. You can also just boot ISO files and run them as a live environment - just as you would booting your computer from a live CD/DVD/USB - without installing it if you prefer. Some common uses for VirtualBox are: - Install a second copy of your main OS for testing and experimentation. - Install other Linux distros that you want to use regularly, but do not want to install as a dual-boot on your computer. - Install, or just run live, other distros for testing purposes. - Install Windows so you can run its programs within Linux without rebooting the computer. (Note: Microsoft considers that to be a separate installation of its software and requires another user license for that.) Installing VirtualBox To install VirtualBox, go to Menu, Settings, Lite Software and find it from the list of software to install. VirtualBox will take a couple of minutes to fully install, so just wait until the screen tells you it is done. After installation is complete, you will find VirtualBox under both the Accessories and System sections of the Menu as PC virtualization solution. VirtualBox does not come pre-configured to use USB sticks. You need to download an extra package for that from their website. Go ahead and start VirtualBox, then follow the steps below to install what you need for USB support. NB: Version numbers for VirtualBox - Please note that new versions are being released regularly, the information here is provided as a guide only. The latest version number of VirtualBox will change with time. You need to know the version number of your VirtualBox installation in order to download the matching \"Extension Pack\". In this example, our version is 6.1.4; but double-check that by clicking Help, About VirtualBox from the main VirtualBox window. Then look along bottom of pop-up window for the version number. For the latest version, go to this VirtualBox webpage. Otherwise, go here, look for your version number and follow same steps as below to continue. Find the Extension Pack listed under the heading for your VirtualBox version and click on All supported platforms to download it. Save the download to your Downloads folder. Choose Open with: VirtualBox. Click on Install. Scroll to the bottom of the License window and click on I Agree. Enter your password. Install complete. Using VirtualBox VirtualBox can boot from either a live CD/DVD or an ISO file saved to your hard drive (HDD). In the following example we'll use a downloaded ISO file. If you are using a bootable CD/DVD, go ahead and load it into the tray before we get started. Menu, System, PC virtualization solution From main VirtualBox window, click the New button to make a new virtual machine environment. Next, choose a Name for the virtual machine, the Type of operating system it will be, and Version of the operating system. When filling in version, specify either 32 or 64-bit system and choose the closest fit for the OS you will be installing if you don't see a listing that matches exactly under the Version drop-down box. In this example, we will make a new machine for another Ubuntu-based distro called Xubuntu 20.04 and we are using its 64-bit version. There is no listing for Xubuntu, so we'll just choose Ubuntu_64 because that is what it is based on. (If you made a virtual machine [VM] with Linux Lite installed, you would also choose Ubuntu for the same reason.) Click Next to continue. Decide how much of your RAM (memory) you want dedicated to operating the VM. 512MB-2GB will likely be fine most of the time. Do not dedicate more than half of your RAM to the VM - that could cause problems with the operation of your host OS, Linux Lite. (The VM is operating from within the host OS - you don't want the VM using more resources than the host itself.) In this example, the computer (host) has 2Gb of RAM, so 1024MB (1Gb) was allotted to the VM. The next screen asks if you want to Create a virtual hard disk now. That is what we want, so we tick that radio button and click Create. We'll choose VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image) from the Hard disk file type screen. We'll choose Dynamically allocated from the Storage on physical hard drive screen. On the next screen we make the virtual drive 10GB. (VirtualBox will dedicate space from your hard drive for the virtual drive - so be sure you have enough room on your HDD to accommodate creating the virtual drive.) After hitting Create your new VM will be listed along the left-hand side of the main VirtualBox window. (At this point, it is just an empty container.) You can adjust a few settings for the VM either before or after installing the OS. We'll do it before installation. Highlight the VM and click Settings. Then, click Display along the left side and adjust the amount of video memory you want the VM to have. (Default is 16MB, we'll give it 128MB in this example.) Also, click to Enable either 3-D or 2-D Acceleration. (If one gives you an \"invalid settings\" message, unclick it and choose the other.) Now, click USB on the left side and make sure that the USB controllers are enabled. This will allow you to copy to/from USB sticks in the VM. Click OK when done to get back to main window. With the VM highlighted on the left of main window, click the Start arrow to begin installation. The first screen you see will ask you what to use as your installation source and the CD/DVD drive will likely be already listed. If that is what you are using and the disk is loaded in the tray, go ahead and hit Start. Otherwise, click on the yellow folder icon to the right. The box below will appear. Browse to where your ISO image is. Click on it and then click on Open. After you've found and selected your ISO, it will appear filled in the source box. Hit Start and it will now boot from the live ISO/CD/DVD. When the live environment finishes loading, click the install icon on the desktop to begin the installer. The installation process is just the same as if you were installing to the computer normally. When asked if you want to \"Erase disk and install\", it is NOT going to erase your real hard drive - it is talking about the virtual hard drive. (Same thing if you choose 'Something else' and partition the drive manually.) After install is complete, reboot the VM. If the installation disk appears to be stuck and not rebooting, click your mouse somewhere inside the VM window, then hit the ENTER key. If nothing happens, click the \"x\" on the VM window and choose to Shutdown the machine. Then just highlight the VM and hit the Start arrow again. In the VM, you can do much the same as when installed for real on your computer. You can install things, download updates, etc., and it all happens within the virtual environment on the virtual HDD. Whenever you want to shutdown a running VM, shutdown using the normal shutdown method of the OS in the VM - not by closing the VM window. (If the VM OS was Linux Lite, you would click Menu, Logout, Shutdown, just like on your computer.) Using USB's in VirtualBox Assuming you've already added the the VirtualBox Extension Pack to begin using USB's in your new VM, you need to add your username to the vboxusers group. (You only need to do that once, not for every individual VM you make.) You should perform the following steps while no VM's are open. Open the Linux Lite (not VirtualBox) Settings Manager, Menu, Settings, Settings Manager and select the Lite User Manager. With your username showing under Select user, scroll down the list in the Groups column and place a check in the box next to vboxusers to add yourself to that group and hit Apply. Close out Lite User Manager, the Settings Manager and any other open programs. Reboot the computer, then log back in for the new setting to take effect. Open VirtualBox and start your new VM. Once up and running you will see a little USB icon along bottom right edge of the VirtualBox window. Right-click on it to choose the USB you want to use.

Upon opening File search, you will see this file search window: Click the 3-dots icon in upper-right corner and choose Refresh search index. Now click on the Unlock button. Enter your password. File search uses the locate command to search for files. The locate command relies on a database it maintains of the files on your computer. That database gets automatically updated periodically - normally once a day. Before conducting a search it is a good idea to manually update the database index to make sure that any file changes made since the last update are reflected in the search results. Update complete. You can also use the 3-dots button for other options like displaying advanced settings in the search window. The advanced settings display lets you filter search results by file modification dates, file types, file extensions, etc. The example below shows a search in my Home folder for any file with car in the file name. To limit the results to only txt files, simply click Documents under File Type in the advanced settings.

Learn how to use it here. Top of page AntiVirus Viruses can occur on any computer system. The following tutorial is a collection of commands that allows you to scan your entire system for viruses. Install the virus scanner: Terminal Command: sudo apt-get install clamav clamav-daemon Download the latest virus definitions: Terminal Command: sudo freshclam If you get the following error in your terminal: Terminal: ERROR: /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log is locked by another process Run the following command in your terminal: Terminal: sudo rm -rf /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log Then run the following command again in your terminal: Terminal Command: sudo freshclam Once your virus database is up to date, proceed to scan your system for viruses: Terminal Command: sudo clamscan -r -i / | grep FOUND >> /home/youruser/virus-scan-report.txt Where youruser is your username. The scan will take anywhere from several minutes to several hours, depending on how many files there are to scan. To just scan your home folder, run the following: Terminal Command: clamscan -r -i /home/youruser/ | grep FOUND >> /home/youruser/virus-scan-report.txt Where youruser is your username. When the scan has finished, open the virus-scan-report.txt in your home folder and look to see where any viruses may be residing: You can then go into the folder where the virus was found and delete it. Be sure to run the following command in your terminal before running a new virus scan to ensure your virus definitions are up to date: Terminal Command: sudo freshclam Then run your new virus scan. FireWall A firewall is a piece of software that determines what network traffic can flow between your computer and your local network and internet. By default, the Firewall is disabled in Linux Lite. How a Firewall works: NETWORK TRAFFIC COMING INTO YOUR PC >>> HITS THE FIREWALL >>> FIREWALL SEES IF THERE IS AN EXISTING RULE TO LET THAT TRAFFIC THROUGH. IF THERE IS A RULE, LET IT THROUGH. IF THERE IS NOT A RULE, BLOCK IT. To enable the firewall: Click on Menu, Settings, Settings Manager. Now click on Firewall Config. Enter your password. Click on the Show Status button. Firewall shows as Disabled. Click on the Enable Firewall button. The Firewall will go through the start up process. Click OK to finish. The Firewall now shows as Enabled. The same application can be used to disable the Firewall, just follow the above steps and choose Disable Firewall instead. To enable the firewall in the Terminal: Terminal Command: sudo systemctl unmask --now firewalld Terminal Command: sudo systemctl enable firewalld Terminal Command: sudo systemctl start firewalld The following command shows the status of your firewall: Terminal Command: sudo firewall-cmd --state With the Firewall enabled, Linux Lite let's through the everyday traffic by default, for example, internet and mail. If you want for example to use DropBox, you will need to make sure it has been ticked in the Services tab, and the relevant ports have been added. Torrent applications and their accompanying ports will also need to be ticked and added to function properly. If you have a firewall elsewhere on your network (like most routers do) then you can disable the firewall permanently by doing the following: Terminal Command: sudo systemctl stop firewalld Terminal Command: sudo systemctl disable firewalld Terminal Command: sudo systemctl mask --now firewalld A list of common ports to work with an Enabled Firewall: Teamviewer - 5938 - TCP & UDP NitroShare - 40818 - TCP & 40816 UDP Printing (Network) - 5353 (mDNS) UDP, 631 (IPP/IPPS) TCP, 9100-9102 (AppSocket/JetDirect) - TCP More will be added here over time. Most common firewall applications are included in FirewallD, they just need to be ticked (enabled). Check the existing lists in FirewallD before adding your own rules. You must enable the Firewall by the Terminal first (see above). Click on Menu, Settings, Firewall. Enter your password. Select Configuration, Permanent before you attempt any type of firewall adjustments. Click on Options in the main menu, Change Default Zone. Select home from the pop up box, then click on OK. We're now set up for home firewall configuration. Now that we're all set up, let's show you how to allow ports through to your computer. In the following example, we'll use SSH, a common protocol for remotely connecting to another computer. Adding a port to an EXISTING service Make sure Configuration is set to Permanent and your Zone is set to home or your changes will not stick. Most SSH servers run on port 22 but this also means that is someone is trying to hack you, this is the first port they will try to attack you on. A clever Server Admin would change this port number before letting the SSH server go live. Let's say it gets changed to Port 6860 for this example. Click on the Services tab and select ssh from the left pane. Then click on +Add at the bottom. Enter in the port number, then click on OK. Enter your password. Port 6860 has now been added. The server admin should now remove port 22 by selecting it and clicking on the -Remove button. Click on Options, Reload Firewalld to activate our new firewall rule, enter your password if prompted. Adding a NEW service Make sure Configuration is set to Permanent and your Zone is set to home or your changes will not stick. In this example, we'll set up a fictitious server and port. Let's call it ACME with port numbers 4545 and 4546 (both using the tcp protocol). Click on the Services tab and click the + sign as shown below. Enter in similar details as you would for your application below. ACME is now added to the application list. Now we just need to add the two ports. Click on Add in the Ports tab and enter in the ports. Enter the port numbers. To make it easy here, just add one at a time. Here our application ACME and it's ports number are all set to go. Click on the Services tab and place a tick in ACME. Click on Options, Reload Firewalld to activate our new firewall rule, enter your password if prompted. Our new Firewall rule is now set up to work properly. Top of page Timeshift Timeshift is a system restore tool for Linux. It provides functionality that is quite similar to the System Restore feature in Windows or the Time Machine tool in MacOS. Timeshift protects your system by making incremental snapshots of the file system manually or at regular automated intervals. These snapshots can then be restored at a later point to undo all changes to the system and restore it to the previous state. Snapshots are made using rsync and hard-links and the tool shares common files amongst snapshots in order to save disk space. Now that we have an idea about what Timeshift is, let us take take a detail look at setting up and using this tool. Go to Menu, System, System Restore Utility. Enter your password. Timeshift supports 2 snapshot formats. The first is by using Rsync and the second is by using the in-built features of BTRFS file system that allows snapshots to be created. Most peoples choice will be Rsync unless you chose the BTRFS file system during your Linux Lite installation. Select Rsync and click on the Next button. The next thing to do is select your snapshot location. You can choose to have your snapshots on your local disk or on an external storage device. Wherever you choose, make sure you have at least 100Gb plus of spare storage. An external hard drive is an wise choice. In the following example, sda5 is our backup location, sda1 is our Linux Lite partition. Click on the Next button. Timeshift allows you to create snapshots on hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or on boot basis. So you can select the frequencies you want and the number of snapshots to keep. Click on Finish to complete your setup. Creating a Restore Point Creating a snapshot is simple. Just click on the Create button and your first snapshot will be created. Depending on what should be included or excluded from the snapshots, it will take several minutes for the process to complete. You can add comments to your snapshots so you can have a description of the snapshot. Settings, Filters You can also specify Filters to include or exclude files or directories from the snapshots. Timeshift is designed to protect system files and settings. User data such as documents, pictures and music are excluded by default. This prevents you from overwriting your documents when you restore a snapshot or using all of your storage to backup media (pictures, music, and video) files. We recommend you use the Backups application in the Accessories menu for your home folder backups, and use Timeshift for system backups, the choice is yours. Clicking on the Summary option under Filters will show you what is included and what is not. Restoring a backup Restoring a Backup is as simple as selecting the snapshot you wish to restore and clicking on the Restore button. Next you will select your target device where files will be restored. You will have to specify your root device and whether or not to keep the boot and home files on the root device or on another partition. You then specify the Bootloader Options as to whether or not to reinstall GRUB2, to update or not intramfs and the Grub Menu. Timeshift will then simulate a Restore by performing a 'Dry run'. This takes place to ensure the Restore process runs without error. On the Confirm Actions window click on Next. The next window is a Warning dialogue that gives you a summary of the Restore process. Click on Next. The Restore process begins. This may take some time. ​The snapshot will be applied and then your computer will restart to complete the process. Many thanks to Mohd Sohail of LinuxAndUbuntu.com for help with this tutorial. Top of page USB Persistence USB Persistence enables the user to have a USB device with Linux Lite installed onto it, that can then be rebooted and all the files and settings are still available. The following tutorial will walk you through how to install Linux Lite to a USB device. We will use mkusb to create our persistent USB. First, we install the mkusb PPA. Complete one line at a time. NOTE: Installing this will remove USB Image Writer and USB Stick Formatter. Terminal Command: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mkusb/ppasudo apt install --install-recommends mkusb mkusb-nox usb-pack-efi Launch mkusb, Menu, System, mkusb. Click on Yes for the dialogue box. Enter your password. Click on OK for the next box. Select Install (make a boot device) and click on OK. Select 'Persistent live' - only Debian and Ubuntu and click on OK. Select the Linux Lite ISO image file. Make sure the correct USB device is listed and selected and click on OK. Select msdos from the list and click on OK. You will need to select upefi if you are using one of our UEFI installs on your UEFI computer. Adjust the slider to your preferences or just accept the default persistence space. This is the space where your settings and files will be saved to so make sure to give it adequate space. When you are ready, select Go then click on the Go button. The application will now go ahead and create the USB persistence for you. This may take some time. The process is now complete. Click on all the Quit options. You can now plug your USB device into a computer and boot from it. Top of page VirtualBox The VirtualBox application allows you to run other OS's (operating systems) within your main OS by creating a container of sorts for them to run in, independently from the main OS. You install other OS's to VirtualBox just like you would to a normal hard drive. VirtualBox creates a virtual hard drive for you to install to and the result is referred to as a Virtual Machine (VM). You can install to VirtualBox using a bootable CD or DVD. Even more conveniently, you can install using a downloaded ISO file without the need to burn it first to a CD/DVD. You can also just boot ISO files and run them as a live environment - just as you would booting your computer from a live CD/DVD/USB - without installing it if you prefer. Some common uses for VirtualBox are: - Install a second copy of your main OS for testing and experimentation. - Install other Linux distros that you want to use regularly, but do not want to install as a dual-boot on your computer. - Install, or just run live, other distros for testing purposes. - Install Windows so you can run its programs within Linux without rebooting the computer. (Note: Microsoft considers that to be a separate installation of its software and requires another user license for that.) Installing VirtualBox To install VirtualBox, go to Menu, Settings, Lite Software and find it from the list of software to install. VirtualBox will take a couple of minutes to fully install, so just wait until the screen tells you it is done. After installation is complete, you will find VirtualBox under both the Accessories and System sections of the Menu as PC virtualization solution. VirtualBox does not come pre-configured to use USB sticks. You need to download an extra package for that from their website. Go ahead and start VirtualBox, then follow the steps below to install what you need for USB support. NB: Version numbers for VirtualBox - Please note that new versions are being released regularly, the information here is provided as a guide only. The latest version number of VirtualBox will change with time. You need to know the version number of your VirtualBox installation in order to download the matching \"Extension Pack\". In this example, our version is 6.1.4; but double-check that by clicking Help, About VirtualBox from the main VirtualBox window. Then look along bottom of pop-up window for the version number. For the latest version, go to this VirtualBox webpage. Otherwise, go here, look for your version number and follow same steps as below to continue. Find the Extension Pack listed under the heading for your VirtualBox version and click on All supported platforms to download it. Save the download to your Downloads folder. Choose Open with: VirtualBox. Click on Install. Scroll to the bottom of the License window and click on I Agree. Enter your password. Install complete. Using VirtualBox VirtualBox can boot from either a live CD/DVD or an ISO file saved to your hard drive (HDD). In the following example we'll use a downloaded ISO file. If you are using a bootable CD/DVD, go ahead and load it into the tray before we get started. Menu, System, PC virtualization solution From main VirtualBox window, click the New button to make a new virtual machine environment. Next, choose a Name for the virtual machine, the Type of operating system it will be, and Version of the operating system. When filling in version, specify either 32 or 64-bit system and choose the closest fit for the OS you will be installing if you don't see a listing that matches exactly under the Version drop-down box. In this example, we will make a new machine for another Ubuntu-based distro called Xubuntu 20.04 and we are using its 64-bit version. There is no listing for Xubuntu, so we'll just choose Ubuntu_64 because that is what it is based on. (If you made a virtual machine [VM] with Linux Lite installed, you would also choose Ubuntu for the same reason.) Click Next to continue. Decide how much of your RAM (memory) you want dedicated to operating the VM. 512MB-2GB will likely be fine most of the time. Do not dedicate more than half of your RAM to the VM - that could cause problems with the operation of your host OS, Linux Lite. (The VM is operating from within the host OS - you don't want the VM using more resources than the host itself.) In this example, the computer (host) has 2Gb of RAM, so 1024MB (1Gb) was allotted to the VM. The next screen asks if you want to Create a virtual hard disk now. That is what we want, so we tick that radio button and click Create. We'll choose VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image) from the Hard disk file type screen. We'll choose Dynamically allocated from the Storage on physical hard drive screen. On the next screen we make the virtual drive 10GB. (VirtualBox will dedicate space from your hard drive for the virtual drive - so be sure you have enough room on your HDD to accommodate creating the virtual drive.) After hitting Create your new VM will be listed along the left-hand side of the main VirtualBox window. (At this point, it is just an empty container.) You can adjust a few settings for the VM either before or after installing the OS. We'll do it before installation. Highlight the VM and click Settings. Then, click Display along the left side and adjust the amount of video memory you want the VM to have. (Default is 16MB, we'll give it 128MB in this example.) Also, click to Enable either 3-D or 2-D Acceleration. (If one gives you an \"invalid settings\" message, unclick it and choose the other.) Now, click USB on the left side and make sure that the USB controllers are enabled. This will allow you to copy to/from USB sticks in the VM. Click OK when done to get back to main window. With the VM highlighted on the left of main window, click the Start arrow to begin installation. The first screen you see will ask you what to use as your installation source and the CD/DVD drive will likely be already listed. If that is what you are using and the disk is loaded in the tray, go ahead and hit Start. Otherwise, click on the yellow folder icon to the right. The box below will appear. Browse to where your ISO image is. Click on it and then click on Open. After you've found and selected your ISO, it will appear filled in the source box. Hit Start and it will now boot from the live ISO/CD/DVD. When the live environment finishes loading, click the install icon on the desktop to begin the installer. The installation process is just the same as if you were installing to the computer normally. When asked if you want to \"Erase disk and install\", it is NOT going to erase your real hard drive - it is talking about the virtual hard drive. (Same thing if you choose 'Something else' and partition the drive manually.) After install is complete, reboot the VM. If the installation disk appears to be stuck and not rebooting, click your mouse somewhere inside the VM window, then hit the ENTER key. If nothing happens, click the \"x\" on the VM window and choose to Shutdown the machine. Then just highlight the VM and hit the Start arrow again. In the VM, you can do much the same as when installed for real on your computer. You can install things, download updates, etc., and it all happens within the virtual environment on the virtual HDD. Whenever you want to shutdown a running VM, shutdown using the normal shutdown method of the OS in the VM - not by closing the VM window. (If the VM OS was Linux Lite, you would click Menu, Logout, Shutdown, just like on your computer.) Using USB's in VirtualBox Assuming you've already added the the VirtualBox Extension Pack to begin using USB's in your new VM, you need to add your username to the vboxusers group. (You only need to do that once, not for every individual VM you make.) You should perform the following steps while no VM's are open. Open the Linux Lite (not VirtualBox) Settings Manager, Menu, Settings, Settings Manager and select the Lite User Manager. With your username showing under Select user, scroll down the list in the Groups column and place a check in the box next to vboxusers to add yourself to that group and hit Apply. Close out Lite User Manager, the Settings Manager and any other open programs. Reboot the computer, then log back in for the new setting to take effect. Open VirtualBox and start your new VM. Once up and running you will see a little USB icon along bottom right edge of the VirtualBox window. Right-click on it to choose the USB you want to use.

Install the virus scanner: Terminal Command: sudo apt-get install clamav clamav-daemon Download the latest virus definitions: Terminal Command: sudo freshclam If you get the following error in your terminal: Terminal: ERROR: /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log is locked by another process Run the following command in your terminal: Terminal: sudo rm -rf /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log Then run the following command again in your terminal: Terminal Command: sudo freshclam Once your virus database is up to date, proceed to scan your system for viruses: Terminal Command: sudo clamscan -r -i / | grep FOUND >> /home/youruser/virus-scan-report.txt Where youruser is your username. The scan will take anywhere from several minutes to several hours, depending on how many files there are to scan. To just scan your home folder, run the following: Terminal Command: clamscan -r -i /home/youruser/ | grep FOUND >> /home/youruser/virus-scan-report.txt Where youruser is your username. When the scan has finished, open the virus-scan-report.txt in your home folder and look to see where any viruses may be residing: You can then go into the folder where the virus was found and delete it. Be sure to run the following command in your terminal before running a new virus scan to ensure your virus definitions are up to date: Terminal Command: sudo freshclam Then run your new virus scan. FireWall A firewall is a piece of software that determines what network traffic can flow between your computer and your local network and internet. By default, the Firewall is disabled in Linux Lite. How a Firewall works: NETWORK TRAFFIC COMING INTO YOUR PC >>> HITS THE FIREWALL >>> FIREWALL SEES IF THERE IS AN EXISTING RULE TO LET THAT TRAFFIC THROUGH. IF THERE IS A RULE, LET IT THROUGH. IF THERE IS NOT A RULE, BLOCK IT. To enable the firewall: Click on Menu, Settings, Settings Manager. Now click on Firewall Config. Enter your password. Click on the Show Status button. Firewall shows as Disabled. Click on the Enable Firewall button. The Firewall will go through the start up process. Click OK to finish. The Firewall now shows as Enabled. The same application can be used to disable the Firewall, just follow the above steps and choose Disable Firewall instead. To enable the firewall in the Terminal: Terminal Command: sudo systemctl unmask --now firewalld Terminal Command: sudo systemctl enable firewalld Terminal Command: sudo systemctl start firewalld The following command shows the status of your firewall: Terminal Command: sudo firewall-cmd --state With the Firewall enabled, Linux Lite let's through the everyday traffic by default, for example, internet and mail. If you want for example to use DropBox, you will need to make sure it has been ticked in the Services tab, and the relevant ports have been added. Torrent applications and their accompanying ports will also need to be ticked and added to function properly. If you have a firewall elsewhere on your network (like most routers do) then you can disable the firewall permanently by doing the following: Terminal Command: sudo systemctl stop firewalld Terminal Command: sudo systemctl disable firewalld Terminal Command: sudo systemctl mask --now firewalld A list of common ports to work with an Enabled Firewall: Teamviewer - 5938 - TCP & UDP NitroShare - 40818 - TCP & 40816 UDP Printing (Network) - 5353 (mDNS) UDP, 631 (IPP/IPPS) TCP, 9100-9102 (AppSocket/JetDirect) - TCP More will be added here over time. Most common firewall applications are included in FirewallD, they just need to be ticked (enabled). Check the existing lists in FirewallD before adding your own rules. You must enable the Firewall by the Terminal first (see above). Click on Menu, Settings, Firewall. Enter your password. Select Configuration, Permanent before you attempt any type of firewall adjustments. Click on Options in the main menu, Change Default Zone. Select home from the pop up box, then click on OK. We're now set up for home firewall configuration. Now that we're all set up, let's show you how to allow ports through to your computer. In the following example, we'll use SSH, a common protocol for remotely connecting to another computer. Adding a port to an EXISTING service Make sure Configuration is set to Permanent and your Zone is set to home or your changes will not stick. Most SSH servers run on port 22 but this also means that is someone is trying to hack you, this is the first port they will try to attack you on. A clever Server Admin would change this port number before letting the SSH server go live. Let's say it gets changed to Port 6860 for this example. Click on the Services tab and select ssh from the left pane. Then click on +Add at the bottom. Enter in the port number, then click on OK. Enter your password. Port 6860 has now been added. The server admin should now remove port 22 by selecting it and clicking on the -Remove button. Click on Options, Reload Firewalld to activate our new firewall rule, enter your password if prompted. Adding a NEW service Make sure Configuration is set to Permanent and your Zone is set to home or your changes will not stick. In this example, we'll set up a fictitious server and port. Let's call it ACME with port numbers 4545 and 4546 (both using the tcp protocol). Click on the Services tab and click the + sign as shown below. Enter in similar details as you would for your application below. ACME is now added to the application list. Now we just need to add the two ports. Click on Add in the Ports tab and enter in the ports. Enter the port numbers. To make it easy here, just add one at a time. Here our application ACME and it's ports number are all set to go. Click on the Services tab and place a tick in ACME. Click on Options, Reload Firewalld to activate our new firewall rule, enter your password if prompted. Our new Firewall rule is now set up to work properly. Top of page Timeshift Timeshift is a system restore tool for Linux.

Most peoples choice will be Rsync unless you chose the BTRFS file system during your Linux Lite installation. Select Rsync and click on the Next button. The next thing to do is select your snapshot location. You can choose to have your snapshots on your local disk or on an external storage device. Wherever you choose, make sure you have at least 100Gb plus of spare storage. An external hard drive is an wise choice. In the following example, sda5 is our backup location, sda1 is our Linux Lite partition. Click on the Next button. Timeshift allows you to create snapshots on hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or on boot basis. So you can select the frequencies you want and the number of snapshots to keep. Click on Finish to complete your setup. Creating a Restore Point Creating a snapshot is simple. Just click on the Create button and your first snapshot will be created. Depending on what should be included or excluded from the snapshots, it will take several minutes for the process to complete. You can add comments to your snapshots so you can have a description of the snapshot. Settings, Filters You can also specify Filters to include or exclude files or directories from the snapshots. Timeshift is designed to protect system files and settings. User data such as documents, pictures and music are excluded by default. This prevents you from overwriting your documents when you restore a snapshot or using all of your storage to backup media (pictures, music, and video) files. We recommend you use the Backups application in the Accessories menu for your home folder backups, and use Timeshift for system backups, the choice is yours. Clicking on the Summary option under Filters will show you what is included and what is not. Restoring a backup Restoring a Backup is as simple as selecting the snapshot you wish to restore and clicking on the Restore button. Next you will select your target device where files will be restored. You will have to specify your root device and whether or not to keep the boot and home files on the root device or on another partition. You then specify the Bootloader Options as to whether or not to reinstall GRUB2, to update or not intramfs and the Grub Menu. Timeshift will then simulate a Restore by performing a 'Dry run'. This takes place to ensure the Restore process runs without error. On the Confirm Actions window click on Next. The next window is a Warning dialogue that gives you a summary of the Restore process. Click on Next. The Restore process begins. This may take some time. ​The snapshot will be applied and then your computer will restart to complete the process. Many thanks to Mohd Sohail of LinuxAndUbuntu.com for help with this tutorial. Top of page USB Persistence USB Persistence enables the user to have a USB device with Linux Lite installed onto it, that can then be rebooted and all the files and settings are still available. The following tutorial will walk you through how to install Linux Lite to a USB device. We will use mkusb to create our persistent USB. First, we install the mkusb PPA. Complete one line at a time. NOTE: Installing this will remove USB Image Writer and USB Stick Formatter. Terminal Command: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mkusb/ppasudo apt install --install-recommends mkusb mkusb-nox usb-pack-efi Launch mkusb, Menu, System, mkusb. Click on Yes for the dialogue box. Enter your password. Click on OK for the next box. Select Install (make a boot device) and click on OK. Select 'Persistent live' - only Debian and Ubuntu and click on OK. Select the Linux Lite ISO image file. Make sure the correct USB device is listed and selected and click on OK. Select msdos from the list and click on OK. You will need to select upefi if you are using one of our UEFI installs on your UEFI computer. Adjust the slider to your preferences or just accept the default persistence space. This is the space where your settings and files will be saved to so make sure to give it adequate space. When you are ready, select Go then click on the Go button. The application will now go ahead and create the USB persistence for you. This may take some time. The process is now complete. Click on all the Quit options. You can now plug your USB device into a computer and boot from it. Top of page VirtualBox The VirtualBox application allows you to run other OS's (operating systems) within your main OS by creating a container of sorts for them to run in, independently from the main OS. You install other OS's to VirtualBox just like you would to a normal hard drive. VirtualBox creates a virtual hard drive for you to install to and the result is referred to as a Virtual Machine (VM). You can install to VirtualBox using a bootable CD or DVD. Even more conveniently, you can install using a downloaded ISO file without the need to burn it first to a CD/DVD. You can also just boot ISO files and run them as a live environment - just as you would booting your computer from a live CD/DVD/USB - without installing it if you prefer. Some common uses for VirtualBox are: - Install a second copy of your main OS for testing and experimentation. - Install other Linux distros that you want to use regularly, but do not want to install as a dual-boot on your computer. - Install, or just run live, other distros for testing purposes. - Install Windows so you can run its programs within Linux without rebooting the computer. (Note: Microsoft considers that to be a separate installation of its software and requires another user license for that.) Installing VirtualBox To install VirtualBox, go to Menu, Settings, Lite Software and find it from the list of software to install. VirtualBox will take a couple of minutes to fully install, so just wait until the screen tells you it is done. After installation is complete, you will find VirtualBox under both the Accessories and System sections of the Menu as PC virtualization solution. VirtualBox does not come pre-configured to use USB sticks. You need to download an extra package for that from their website. Go ahead and start VirtualBox, then follow the steps below to install what you need for USB support. NB: Version numbers for VirtualBox - Please note that new versions are being released regularly, the information here is provided as a guide only. The latest version number of VirtualBox will change with time. You need to know the version number of your VirtualBox installation in order to download the matching \"Extension Pack\". In this example, our version is 6.1.4; but double-check that by clicking Help, About VirtualBox from the main VirtualBox window. Then look along bottom of pop-up window for the version number. For the latest version, go to this VirtualBox webpage. Otherwise, go here, look for your version number and follow same steps as below to continue. Find the Extension Pack listed under the heading for your VirtualBox version and click on All supported platforms to download it. Save the download to your Downloads folder. Choose Open with: VirtualBox. Click on Install. Scroll to the bottom of the License window and click on I Agree. Enter your password. Install complete. Using VirtualBox VirtualBox can boot from either a live CD/DVD or an ISO file saved to your hard drive (HDD). In the following example we'll use a downloaded ISO file. If you are using a bootable CD/DVD, go ahead and load it into the tray before we get started. Menu, System, PC virtualization solution From main VirtualBox window, click the New button to make a new virtual machine environment. Next, choose a Name for the virtual machine, the Type of operating system it will be, and Version of the operating system. When filling in version, specify either 32 or 64-bit system and choose the closest fit for the OS you will be installing if you don't see a listing that matches exactly under the Version drop-down box. In this example, we will make a new machine for another Ubuntu-based distro called Xubuntu 20.04 and we are using its 64-bit version. There is no listing for Xubuntu, so we'll just choose Ubuntu_64 because that is what it is based on. (If you made a virtual machine [VM] with Linux Lite installed, you would also choose Ubuntu for the same reason.) Click Next to continue. Decide how much of your RAM (memory) you want dedicated to operating the VM. 512MB-2GB will likely be fine most of the time. Do not dedicate more than half of your RAM to the VM - that could cause problems with the operation of your host OS, Linux Lite. (The VM is operating from within the host OS - you don't want the VM using more resources than the host itself.) In this example, the computer (host) has 2Gb of RAM, so 1024MB (1Gb) was allotted to the VM. The next screen asks if you want to Create a virtual hard disk now. That is what we want, so we tick that radio button and click Create. We'll choose VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image) from the Hard disk file type screen. We'll choose Dynamically allocated from the Storage on physical hard drive screen. On the next screen we make the virtual drive 10GB. (VirtualBox will dedicate space from your hard drive for the virtual drive - so be sure you have enough room on your HDD to accommodate creating the virtual drive.) After hitting Create your new VM will be listed along the left-hand side of the main VirtualBox window. (At this point, it is just an empty container.) You can adjust a few settings for the VM either before or after installing the OS. We'll do it before installation. Highlight the VM and click Settings. Then, click Display along the left side and adjust the amount of video memory you want the VM to have. (Default is 16MB, we'll give it 128MB in this example.) Also, click to Enable either 3-D or 2-D Acceleration. (If one gives you an \"invalid settings\" message, unclick it and choose the other.) Now, click USB on the left side and make sure that the USB controllers are enabled. This will allow you to copy to/from USB sticks in the VM. Click OK when done to get back to main window. With the VM highlighted on the left of main window, click the Start arrow to begin installation. The first screen you see will ask you what to use as your installation source and the CD/DVD drive will likely be already listed. If that is what you are using and the disk is loaded in the tray, go ahead and hit Start. Otherwise, click on the yellow folder icon to the right. The box below will appear. Browse to where your ISO image is. Click on it and then click on Open. After you've found and selected your ISO, it will appear filled in the source box. Hit Start and it will now boot from the live ISO/CD/DVD. When the live environment finishes loading, click the install icon on the desktop to begin the installer. The installation process is just the same as if you were installing to the computer normally. When asked if you want to \"Erase disk and install\", it is NOT going to erase your real hard drive - it is talking about the virtual hard drive. (Same thing if you choose 'Something else' and partition the drive manually.) After install is complete, reboot the VM. If the installation disk appears to be stuck and not rebooting, click your mouse somewhere inside the VM window, then hit the ENTER key. If nothing happens, click the \"x\" on the VM window and choose to Shutdown the machine. Then just highlight the VM and hit the Start arrow again. In the VM, you can do much the same as when installed for real on your computer. You can install things, download updates, etc., and it all happens within the virtual environment on the virtual HDD. Whenever you want to shutdown a running VM, shutdown using the normal shutdown method of the OS in the VM - not by closing the VM window. (If the VM OS was Linux Lite, you would click Menu, Logout, Shutdown, just like on your computer.) Using USB's in VirtualBox Assuming you've already added the the VirtualBox Extension Pack to begin using USB's in your new VM, you need to add your username to the vboxusers group. (You only need to do that once, not for every individual VM you make.) You should perform the following steps while no VM's are open. Open the Linux Lite (not VirtualBox) Settings Manager, Menu, Settings, Settings Manager and select the Lite User Manager. With your username showing under Select user, scroll down the list in the Groups column and place a check in the box next to vboxusers to add yourself to that group and hit Apply. Close out Lite User Manager, the Settings Manager and any other open programs. Reboot the computer, then log back in for the new setting to take effect. Open VirtualBox and start your new VM. Once up and running you will see a little USB icon along bottom right edge of the VirtualBox window. Right-click on it to choose the USB you want to use.

Upon opening File search, you will see this file search window: Click the 3-dots icon in upper-right corner and choose Refresh search index. Now click on the Unlock button. Enter your password. File search uses the locate command to search for files. The locate command relies on a database it maintains of the files on your computer. That database gets automatically updated periodically - normally once a day. Before conducting a search it is a good idea to manually update the database index to make sure that any file changes made since the last update are reflected in the search results. Update complete. You can also use the 3-dots button for other options like displaying advanced settings in the search window. The advanced settings display lets you filter search results by file modification dates, file types, file extensions, etc. The example below shows a search in my Home folder for any file with car in the file name. To limit the results to only txt files, simply click Documents under File Type in the advanced settings. Top of page AntiVirus - scan your system for viruses.

Many will be for software that needs to be installed first because it is not part of the standard installation. What you will see when installing from Menu, Settings, Lite Software. Lite Software below. Learn how to use it here. What you will see when installing from Menu, System, Package Manager (Synaptic Package Manager). The Synaptic Package Manager below. Learn how to use it here. Top of page AntiVirus Viruses can occur on any computer system. The following tutorial is a collection of commands that allows you to scan your entire system for viruses. Install the virus scanner: Terminal Command: sudo apt-get install clamav clamav-daemon Download the latest virus definitions: Terminal Command: sudo freshclam If you get the following error in your terminal: Terminal: ERROR: /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log is locked by another process Run the following command in your terminal: Terminal: sudo rm -rf /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log Then run the following command again in your terminal: Terminal Command: sudo freshclam Once your virus database is up to date, proceed to scan your system for viruses: Terminal Command: sudo clamscan -r -i / | grep FOUND >> /home/youruser/virus-scan-report.txt Where youruser is your username. The scan will take anywhere from several minutes to several hours, depending on how many files there are to scan. To just scan your home folder, run the following: Terminal Command: clamscan -r -i /home/youruser/ | grep FOUND >> /home/youruser/virus-scan-report.txt Where youruser is your username. When the scan has finished, open the virus-scan-report.txt in your home folder and look to see where any viruses may be residing: You can then go into the folder where the virus was found and delete it. Be sure to run the following command in your terminal before running a new virus scan to ensure your virus definitions are up to date: Terminal Command: sudo freshclam Then run your new virus scan. FireWall A firewall is a piece of software that determines what network traffic can flow between your computer and your local network and internet. By default, the Firewall is disabled in Linux Lite. How a Firewall works: NETWORK TRAFFIC COMING INTO YOUR PC >>> HITS THE FIREWALL >>> FIREWALL SEES IF THERE IS AN EXISTING RULE TO LET THAT TRAFFIC THROUGH. IF THERE IS A RULE, LET IT THROUGH. IF THERE IS NOT A RULE, BLOCK IT. To enable the firewall: Click on Menu, Settings, Settings Manager. Now click on Firewall Config. Enter your password. Click on the Show Status button. Firewall shows as Disabled. Click on the Enable Firewall button. The Firewall will go through the start up process. Click OK to finish. The Firewall now shows as Enabled. The same application can be used to disable the Firewall, just follow the above steps and choose Disable Firewall instead. To enable the firewall in the Terminal: Terminal Command: sudo systemctl unmask --now firewalld Terminal Command: sudo systemctl enable firewalld Terminal Command: sudo systemctl start firewalld The following command shows the status of your firewall: Terminal Command: sudo firewall-cmd --state With the Firewall enabled, Linux Lite let's through the everyday traffic by default, for example, internet and mail. If you want for example to use DropBox, you will need to make sure it has been ticked in the Services tab, and the relevant ports have been added. Torrent applications and their accompanying ports will also need to be ticked and added to function properly. If you have a firewall elsewhere on your network (like most routers do) then you can disable the firewall permanently by doing the following: Terminal Command: sudo systemctl stop firewalld Terminal Command: sudo systemctl disable firewalld Terminal Command: sudo systemctl mask --now firewalld A list of common ports to work with an Enabled Firewall: Teamviewer - 5938 - TCP & UDP NitroShare - 40818 - TCP & 40816 UDP Printing (Network) - 5353 (mDNS) UDP, 631 (IPP/IPPS) TCP, 9100-9102 (AppSocket/JetDirect) - TCP More will be added here over time. Most common firewall applications are included in FirewallD, they just need to be ticked (enabled). Check the existing lists in FirewallD before adding your own rules. You must enable the Firewall by the Terminal first (see above). Click on Menu, Settings, Firewall. Enter your password. Select Configuration, Permanent before you attempt any type of firewall adjustments. Click on Options in the main menu, Change Default Zone. Select home from the pop up box, then click on OK. We're now set up for home firewall configuration. Now that we're all set up, let's show you how to allow ports through to your computer. In the following example, we'll use SSH, a common protocol for remotely connecting to another computer. Adding a port to an EXISTING service Make sure Configuration is set to Permanent and your Zone is set to home or your changes will not stick. Most SSH servers run on port 22 but this also means that is someone is trying to hack you, this is the first port they will try to attack you on. A clever Server Admin would change this port number before letting the SSH server go live. Let's say it gets changed to Port 6860 for this example. Click on the Services tab and select ssh from the left pane. Then click on +Add at the bottom. Enter in the port number, then click on OK. Enter your password. Port 6860 has now been added. The server admin should now remove port 22 by selecting it and clicking on the -Remove button. Click on Options, Reload Firewalld to activate our new firewall rule, enter your password if prompted. Adding a NEW service Make sure Configuration is set to Permanent and your Zone is set to home or your changes will not stick. In this example, we'll set up a fictitious server and port. Let's call it ACME with port numbers 4545 and 4546 (both using the tcp protocol). Click on the Services tab and click the + sign as shown below. Enter in similar details as you would for your application below. ACME is now added to the application list. Now we just need to add the two ports. Click on Add in the Ports tab and enter in the ports. Enter the port numbers. To make it easy here, just add one at a time. Here our application ACME and it's ports number are all set to go. Click on the Services tab and place a tick in ACME. Click on Options, Reload Firewalld to activate our new firewall rule, enter your password if prompted. Our new Firewall rule is now set up to work properly. Top of page Timeshift Timeshift is a system restore tool for Linux. It provides functionality that is quite similar to the System Restore feature in Windows or the Time Machine tool in MacOS. Timeshift protects your system by making incremental snapshots of the file system manually or at regular automated intervals. These snapshots can then be restored at a later point to undo all changes to the system and restore it to the previous state. Snapshots are made using rsync and hard-links and the tool shares common files amongst snapshots in order to save disk space. Now that we have an idea about what Timeshift is, let us take take a detail look at setting up and using this tool. Go to Menu, System, System Restore Utility. Enter your password. Timeshift supports 2 snapshot formats. The first is by using Rsync and the second is by using the in-built features of BTRFS file system that allows snapshots to be created. Most peoples choice will be Rsync unless you chose the BTRFS file system during your Linux Lite installation. Select Rsync and click on the Next button. The next thing to do is select your snapshot location. You can choose to have your snapshots on your local disk or on an external storage device. Wherever you choose, make sure you have at least 100Gb plus of spare storage. An external hard drive is an wise choice. In the following example, sda5 is our backup location, sda1 is our Linux Lite partition. Click on the Next button. Timeshift allows you to create snapshots on hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or on boot basis. So you can select the frequencies you want and the number of snapshots to keep. Click on Finish to complete your setup. Creating a Restore Point Creating a snapshot is simple. Just click on the Create button and your first snapshot will be created. Depending on what should be included or excluded from the snapshots, it will take several minutes for the process to complete. You can add comments to your snapshots so you can have a description of the snapshot. Settings, Filters You can also specify Filters to include or exclude files or directories from the snapshots. Timeshift is designed to protect system files and settings. User data such as documents, pictures and music are excluded by default. This prevents you from overwriting your documents when you restore a snapshot or using all of your storage to backup media (pictures, music, and video) files. We recommend you use the Backups application in the Accessories menu for your home folder backups, and use Timeshift for system backups, the choice is yours. Clicking on the Summary option under Filters will show you what is included and what is not. Restoring a backup Restoring a Backup is as simple as selecting the snapshot you wish to restore and clicking on the Restore button. Next you will select your target device where files will be restored. You will have to specify your root device and whether or not to keep the boot and home files on the root device or on another partition. You then specify the Bootloader Options as to whether or not to reinstall GRUB2, to update or not intramfs and the Grub Menu. Timeshift will then simulate a Restore by performing a 'Dry run'. This takes place to ensure the Restore process runs without error. On the Confirm Actions window click on Next. The next window is a Warning dialogue that gives you a summary of the Restore process. Click on Next. The Restore process begins. This may take some time. ​The snapshot will be applied and then your computer will restart to complete the process. Many thanks to Mohd Sohail of LinuxAndUbuntu.com for help with this tutorial. Top of page USB Persistence USB Persistence enables the user to have a USB device with Linux Lite installed onto it, that can then be rebooted and all the files and settings are still available. The following tutorial will walk you through how to install Linux Lite to a USB device. We will use mkusb to create our persistent USB. First, we install the mkusb PPA. Complete one line at a time. NOTE: Installing this will remove USB Image Writer and USB Stick Formatter. Terminal Command: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mkusb/ppasudo apt install --install-recommends mkusb mkusb-nox usb-pack-efi Launch mkusb, Menu, System, mkusb. Click on Yes for the dialogue box. Enter your password. Click on OK for the next box. Select Install (make a boot device) and click on OK. Select 'Persistent live' - only Debian and Ubuntu and click on OK. Select the Linux Lite ISO image file. Make sure the correct USB device is listed and selected and click on OK. Select msdos from the list and click on OK. You will need to select upefi if you are using one of our UEFI installs on your UEFI computer. Adjust the slider to your preferences or just accept the default persistence space. This is the space where your settings and files will be saved to so make sure to give it adequate space. When you are ready, select Go then click on the Go button. The application will now go ahead and create the USB persistence for you. This may take some time. The process is now complete. Click on all the Quit options. You can now plug your USB device into a computer and boot from it. Top of page VirtualBox The VirtualBox application allows you to run other OS's (operating systems) within your main OS by creating a container of sorts for them to run in, independently from the main OS. You install other OS's to VirtualBox just like you would to a normal hard drive. VirtualBox creates a virtual hard drive for you to install to and the result is referred to as a Virtual Machine (VM). You can install to VirtualBox using a bootable CD or DVD. Even more conveniently, you can install using a downloaded ISO file without the need to burn it first to a CD/DVD. You can also just boot ISO files and run them as a live environment - just as you would booting your computer from a live CD/DVD/USB - without installing it if you prefer. Some common uses for VirtualBox are: - Install a second copy of your main OS for testing and experimentation. - Install other Linux distros that you want to use regularly, but do not want to install as a dual-boot on your computer. - Install, or just run live, other distros for testing purposes. - Install Windows so you can run its programs within Linux without rebooting the computer. (Note: Microsoft considers that to be a separate installation of its software and requires another user license for that.) Installing VirtualBox To install VirtualBox, go to Menu, Settings, Lite Software and find it from the list of software to install. VirtualBox will take a couple of minutes to fully install, so just wait until the screen tells you it is done. After installation is complete, you will find VirtualBox under both the Accessories and System sections of the Menu as PC virtualization solution. VirtualBox does not come pre-configured to use USB sticks. You need to download an extra package for that from their website. Go ahead and start VirtualBox, then follow the steps below to install what you need for USB support. NB: Version numbers for VirtualBox - Please note that new versions are being released regularly, the information here is provided as a guide only. The latest version number of VirtualBox will change with time. You need to know the version number of your VirtualBox installation in order to download the matching \"Extension Pack\". In this example, our version is 6.1.4; but double-check that by clicking Help, About VirtualBox from the main VirtualBox window. Then look along bottom of pop-up window for the version number. For the latest version, go to this VirtualBox webpage. Otherwise, go here, look for your version number and follow same steps as below to continue. Find the Extension Pack listed under the heading for your VirtualBox version and click on All supported platforms to download it. Save the download to your Downloads folder. Choose Open with: VirtualBox. Click on Install. Scroll to the bottom of the License window and click on I Agree. Enter your password. Install complete. Using VirtualBox VirtualBox can boot from either a live CD/DVD or an ISO file saved to your hard drive (HDD). In the following example we'll use a downloaded ISO file. If you are using a bootable CD/DVD, go ahead and load it into the tray before we get started. Menu, System, PC virtualization solution From main VirtualBox window, click the New button to make a new virtual machine environment. Next, choose a Name for the virtual machine, the Type of operating system it will be, and Version of the operating system. When filling in version, specify either 32 or 64-bit system and choose the closest fit for the OS you will be installing if you don't see a listing that matches exactly under the Version drop-down box. In this example, we will make a new machine for another Ubuntu-based distro called Xubuntu 20.04 and we are using its 64-bit version. There is no listing for Xubuntu, so we'll just choose Ubuntu_64 because that is what it is based on. (If you made a virtual machine [VM] with Linux Lite installed, you would also choose Ubuntu for the same reason.) Click Next to continue. Decide how much of your RAM (memory) you want dedicated to operating the VM. 512MB-2GB will likely be fine most of the time. Do not dedicate more than half of your RAM to the VM - that could cause problems with the operation of your host OS, Linux Lite. (The VM is operating from within the host OS - you don't want the VM using more resources than the host itself.) In this example, the computer (host) has 2Gb of RAM, so 1024MB (1Gb) was allotted to the VM. The next screen asks if you want to Create a virtual hard disk now. That is what we want, so we tick that radio button and click Create. We'll choose VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image) from the Hard disk file type screen. We'll choose Dynamically allocated from the Storage on physical hard drive screen. On the next screen we make the virtual drive 10GB. (VirtualBox will dedicate space from your hard drive for the virtual drive - so be sure you have enough room on your HDD to accommodate creating the virtual drive.) After hitting Create your new VM will be listed along the left-hand side of the main VirtualBox window. (At this point, it is just an empty container.) You can adjust a few settings for the VM either before or after installing the OS. We'll do it before installation. Highlight the VM and click Settings. Then, click Display along the left side and adjust the amount of video memory you want the VM to have. (Default is 16MB, we'll give it 128MB in this example.) Also, click to Enable either 3-D or 2-D Acceleration. (If one gives you an \"invalid settings\" message, unclick it and choose the other.) Now, click USB on the left side and make sure that the USB controllers are enabled. This will allow you to copy to/from USB sticks in the VM. Click OK when done to get back to main window. With the VM highlighted on the left of main window, click the Start arrow to begin installation. The first screen you see will ask you what to use as your installation source and the CD/DVD drive will likely be already listed. If that is what you are using and the disk is loaded in the tray, go ahead and hit Start. Otherwise, click on the yellow folder icon to the right. The box below will appear. Browse to where your ISO image is. Click on it and then click on Open. After you've found and selected your ISO, it will appear filled in the source box. Hit Start and it will now boot from the live ISO/CD/DVD. When the live environment finishes loading, click the install icon on the desktop to begin the installer. The installation process is just the same as if you were installing to the computer normally. When asked if you want to \"Erase disk and install\", it is NOT going to erase your real hard drive - it is talking about the virtual hard drive. (Same thing if you choose 'Something else' and partition the drive manually.) After install is complete, reboot the VM. If the installation disk appears to be stuck and not rebooting, click your mouse somewhere inside the VM window, then hit the ENTER key. If nothing happens, click the \"x\" on the VM window and choose to Shutdown the machine. Then just highlight the VM and hit the Start arrow again. In the VM, you can do much the same as when installed for real on your computer. You can install things, download updates, etc., and it all happens within the virtual environment on the virtual HDD. Whenever you want to shutdown a running VM, shutdown using the normal shutdown method of the OS in the VM - not by closing the VM window. (If the VM OS was Linux Lite, you would click Menu, Logout, Shutdown, just like on your computer.) Using USB's in VirtualBox Assuming you've already added the the VirtualBox Extension Pack to begin using USB's in your new VM, you need to add your username to the vboxusers group. (You only need to do that once, not for every individual VM you make.) You should perform the following steps while no VM's are open. Open the Linux Lite (not VirtualBox) Settings Manager, Menu, Settings, Settings Manager and select the Lite User Manager. With your username showing under Select user, scroll down the list in the Groups column and place a check in the box next to vboxusers to add yourself to that group and hit Apply. Close out Lite User Manager, the Settings Manager and any other open programs. Reboot the computer, then log back in for the new setting to take effect. Open VirtualBox and start your new VM. Once up and running you will see a little USB icon along bottom right edge of the VirtualBox window. Right-click on it to choose the USB you want to use.

Install the virus scanner: Terminal Command: Download the latest virus definitions: Terminal Command: If you get the following error in your terminal: Terminal: Run the following command in your terminal: Terminal: Then run the following command again in your terminal: Terminal Command: Once your virus database is up to date, proceed to scan your system for viruses: Terminal Command: Where youruser is your username. The scan will take anywhere from several minutes to several hours, depending on how many files there are to scan. To just scan your home folder, run the following: Terminal Command: Where youruser is your username. When the scan has finished, open the virus-scan-report.txt in your home folder and look to see where any viruses may be residing: You can then go into the folder where the virus was found and delete it. Be sure to run the following command in your terminal before running a new virus scan to ensure your virus definitions are up to date: Terminal Command: Then run your new virus scan. FireWall A firewall is a piece of software that determines what network traffic can flow between your computer and your local network and internet. By default, the Firewall is disabled in Linux Lite. How a Firewall works: NETWORK TRAFFIC COMING INTO YOUR PC >>> HITS THE FIREWALL >>> FIREWALL SEES IF THERE IS AN EXISTING RULE TO LET THAT TRAFFIC THROUGH. IF THERE IS A RULE, LET IT THROUGH. IF THERE IS NOT A RULE, BLOCK IT. To enable the firewall: Click on Menu, Settings, Settings Manager. Now click on Firewall Config. Enter your password. Click on the Show Status button. Firewall shows as Disabled. Click on the Enable Firewall button. The Firewall will go through the start up process. Click OK to finish. The Firewall now shows as Enabled. The same application can be used to disable the Firewall, just follow the above steps and choose Disable Firewall instead. To enable the firewall in the Terminal: Terminal Command: Terminal Command: Terminal Command: The following command shows the status of your firewall: Terminal Command: With the Firewall enabled, Linux Lite let's through the everyday traffic by default, for example, internet and mail. If you want for example to use DropBox, you will need to make sure it has been ticked in the Services tab, and the relevant ports have been added. Torrent applications and their accompanying ports will also need to be ticked and added to function properly. If you have a firewall elsewhere on your network (like most routers do) then you can disable the firewall permanently by doing the following: Terminal Command: Terminal Command: Terminal Command: A list of common ports to work with an Enabled Firewall: Teamviewer - 5938 - TCP & UDP NitroShare - 40818 - TCP & 40816 UDP Printing (Network) - 5353 (mDNS) UDP, 631 (IPP/IPPS) TCP, 9100-9102 (AppSocket/JetDirect) - TCP More will be added here over time. Most common firewall applications are included in FirewallD, they just need to be ticked (enabled). Check the existing lists in FirewallD before adding your own rules. You must enable the Firewall by the Terminal first (see above). Click on Menu, Settings, Firewall. Enter your password. Select Configuration, Permanent before you attempt any type of firewall adjustments. Click on Options in the main menu, Change Default Zone. Select home from the pop up box, then click on OK. We're now set up for home firewall configuration. Now that we're all set up, let's show you how to allow ports through to your computer. In the following example, we'll use SSH, a common protocol for remotely connecting to another computer. Adding a port to an EXISTING service Make sure Configuration is set to Permanent and your Zone is set to home or your changes will not stick. Most SSH servers run on port 22 but this also means that is someone is trying to hack you, this is the first port they will try to attack you on. A clever Server Admin would change this port number before letting the SSH server go live. Let's say it gets changed to Port 6860 for this example. Click on the Services tab and select ssh from the left pane. Then click on +Add at the bottom. Enter in the port number, then click on OK. Enter your password. Port 6860 has now been added. The server admin should now remove port 22 by selecting it and clicking on the -Remove button. Click on Options, Reload Firewalld to activate our new firewall rule, enter your password if prompted. Adding a NEW service Make sure Configuration is set to Permanent and your Zone is set to home or your changes will not stick. In this example, we'll set up a fictitious server and port. Let's call it ACME with port numbers 4545 and 4546 (both using the tcp protocol). Click on the Services tab and click the + sign as shown below. Enter in similar details as you would for your application below. ACME is now added to the application list. Now we just need to add the two ports. Click on Add in the Ports tab and enter in the ports. Enter the port numbers. To make it easy here, just add one at a time. Here our application ACME and it's ports number are all set to go. Click on the Services tab and place a tick in ACME. Click on Options, Reload Firewalld to activate our new firewall rule, enter your password if prompted. Our new Firewall rule is now set up to work properly. Top of page Timeshift Timeshift is a system restore tool for Linux. It provides functionality that is quite similar to the System Restore feature in Windows or the Time Machine tool in MacOS. Timeshift protects your system by making incremental snapshots of the file system manually or at regular automated intervals. These snapshots can then be restored at a later point to undo all changes to the system and restore it to the previous state. Snapshots are made using rsync and hard-links and the tool shares common files amongst snapshots in order to save disk space. Now that we have an idea about what Timeshift is, let us take take a detail look at setting up and using this tool. Go to Menu, System, System Restore Utility. Enter your password. Timeshift supports 2 snapshot formats. The first is by using Rsync and the second is by using the in-built features of BTRFS file system that allows snapshots to be created. Most peoples choice will be Rsync unless you chose the BTRFS file system during your Linux Lite installation. Select Rsync and click on the Next button. The next thing to do is select your snapshot location. You can choose to have your snapshots on your local disk or on an external storage device. Wherever you choose, make sure you have at least 100Gb plus of spare storage. An external hard drive is an wise choice. In the following example, sda5 is our backup location, sda1 is our Linux Lite partition. Click on the Next button. Timeshift allows you to create snapshots on hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or on boot basis. So you can select the frequencies you want and the number of snapshots to keep. Click on Finish to complete your setup. Creating a Restore Point Creating a snapshot is simple. Just click on the Create button and your first snapshot will be created. Depending on what should be included or excluded from the snapshots, it will take several minutes for the process to complete. You can add comments to your snapshots so you can have a description of the snapshot. Settings, Filters You can also specify Filters to include or exclude files or directories from the snapshots. Timeshift is designed to protect system files and settings. User data such as documents, pictures and music are excluded by default. This prevents you from overwriting your documents when you restore a snapshot or using all of your storage to backup media (pictures, music, and video) files. We recommend you use the Backups application in the Accessories menu for your home folder backups, and use Timeshift for system backups, the choice is yours. Clicking on the Summary option under Filters will show you what is included and what is not. Restoring a backup Restoring a Backup is as simple as selecting the snapshot you wish to restore and clicking on the Restore button. Next you will select your target device where files will be restored. You will have to specify your root device and whether or not to keep the boot and home files on the root device or on another partition. You then specify the Bootloader Options as to whether or not to reinstall GRUB2, to update or not intramfs and the Grub Menu. Timeshift will then simulate a Restore by performing a 'Dry run'. This takes place to ensure the Restore process runs without error. On the Confirm Actions window click on Next. The next window is a Warning dialogue that gives you a summary of the Restore process. Click on Next. The Restore process begins. This may take some time. ​The snapshot will be applied and then your computer will restart to complete the process.

Top of page USB Persistence USB Persistence enables the user to have a USB device with Linux Lite installed onto it, that can then be rebooted and all the files and settings are still available. The following tutorial will walk you through how to install Linux Lite to a USB device. We will use mkusb to create our persistent USB. First, we install the mkusb PPA. Complete one line at a time. NOTE: Installing this will remove USB Image Writer and USB Stick Formatter. Terminal Command: Launch mkusb, Menu, System, mkusb. Click on Yes for the dialogue box. Enter your password. Click on OK for the next box. Select Install (make a boot device) and click on OK. Select 'Persistent live' - only Debian and Ubuntu and click on OK. Select the Linux Lite ISO image file. Make sure the correct USB device is listed and selected and click on OK. Select msdos from the list and click on OK. You will need to select upefi if you are using one of our UEFI installs on your UEFI computer. Adjust the slider to your preferences or just accept the default persistence space. This is the space where your settings and files will be saved to so make sure to give it adequate space. When you are ready, select Go then click on the Go button. The application will now go ahead and create the USB persistence for you. This may take some time. The process is now complete. Click on all the Quit options. You can now plug your USB device into a computer and boot from it. Top of page VirtualBox The VirtualBox application allows you to run other OS's (operating systems) within your main OS by creating a container of sorts for them to run in, independently from the main OS. You install other OS's to VirtualBox just like you would to a normal hard drive. VirtualBox creates a virtual hard drive for you to install to and the result is referred to as a Virtual Machine (VM). You can install to VirtualBox using a bootable CD or DVD. Even more conveniently, you can install using a downloaded ISO file without the need to burn it first to a CD/DVD. You can also just boot ISO files and run them as a live environment - just as you would booting your computer from a live CD/DVD/USB - without installing it if you prefer. Some common uses for VirtualBox are: - Install a second copy of your main OS for testing and experimentation. - Install other Linux distros that you want to use regularly, but do not want to install as a dual-boot on your computer. - Install, or just run live, other distros for testing purposes. - Install Windows so you can run its programs within Linux without rebooting the computer. (Note: Microsoft considers that to be a separate installation of its software and requires another user license for that.) Installing VirtualBox To install VirtualBox, go to Menu, Settings, Lite Software and find it from the list of software to install. VirtualBox will take a couple of minutes to fully install, so just wait until the screen tells you it is done. After installation is complete, you will find VirtualBox under both the Accessories and System sections of the Menu as PC virtualization solution. VirtualBox does not come pre-configured to use USB sticks. You need to download an extra package for that from their website. Go ahead and start VirtualBox, then follow the steps below to install what you need for USB support. NB: Version numbers for VirtualBox - Please note that new versions are being released regularly, the information here is provided as a guide only. The latest version number of VirtualBox will change with time. You need to know the version number of your VirtualBox installation in order to download the matching \"Extension Pack\". In this example, our version is 6.1.4; but double-check that by clicking Help, About VirtualBox from the main VirtualBox window. Then look along bottom of pop-up window for the version number. For the latest version, go to this VirtualBox webpage. Otherwise, go here, look for your version number and follow same steps as below to continue. Find the Extension Pack listed under the heading for your VirtualBox version and click on All supported platforms to download it. Save the download to your Downloads folder. Choose Open with: VirtualBox. Click on Install. Scroll to the bottom of the License window and click on I Agree. Enter your password. Install complete. Using VirtualBox VirtualBox can boot from either a live CD/DVD or an ISO file saved to your hard drive (HDD). In the following example we'll use a downloaded ISO file. If you are using a bootable CD/DVD, go ahead and load it into the tray before we get started. Menu, System, PC virtualization solution From main VirtualBox window, click the New button to make a new virtual machine environment. Next, choose a Name for the virtual machine, the Type of operating system it will be, and Version of the operating system. When filling in version, specify either 32 or 64-bit system and choose the closest fit for the OS you will be installing if you don't see a listing that matches exactly under the Version drop-down box. In this example, we will make a new machine for another Ubuntu-based distro called Xubuntu 20.04 and we are using its 64-bit version. There is no listing for Xubuntu, so we'll just choose Ubuntu_64 because that is what it is based on. (If you made a virtual machine [VM] with Linux Lite installed, you would also choose Ubuntu for the same reason.) Click Next to continue. Decide how much of your RAM (memory) you want dedicated to operating the VM. 512MB-2GB will likely be fine most of the time. Do not dedicate more than half of your RAM to the VM - that could cause problems with the operation of your host OS, Linux Lite. (The VM is operating from within the host OS - you don't want the VM using more resources than the host itself.) In this example, the computer (host) has 2Gb of RAM, so 1024MB (1Gb) was allotted to the VM. The next screen asks if you want to Create a virtual hard disk now. That is what we want, so we tick that radio button and click Create. We'll choose VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image) from the Hard disk file type screen. We'll choose Dynamically allocated from the Storage on physical hard drive screen. On the next screen we make the virtual drive 10GB. (VirtualBox will dedicate space from your hard drive for the virtual drive - so be sure you have enough room on your HDD to accommodate creating the virtual drive.) After hitting Create your new VM will be listed along the left-hand side of the main VirtualBox window. (At this point, it is just an empty container.) You can adjust a few settings for the VM either before or after installing the OS. We'll do it before installation. Highlight the VM and click Settings. Then, click Display along the left side and adjust the amount of video memory you want the VM to have. (Default is 16MB, we'll give it 128MB in this example.) Also, click to Enable either 3-D or 2-D Acceleration. (If one gives you an \"invalid settings\" message, unclick it and choose the other.) Now, click USB on the left side and make sure that the USB controllers are enabled. This will allow you to copy to/from USB sticks in the VM. Click OK when done to get back to main window. With the VM highlighted on the left of main window, click the Start arrow to begin installation. The first screen you see will ask you what to use as your installation source and the CD/DVD drive will likely be already listed. If that is what you are using and the disk is loaded in the tray, go ahead and hit Start. Otherwise, click on the yellow folder icon to the right. The box below will appear. Browse to where your ISO image is. Click on it and then click on Open. After you've found and selected your ISO, it will appear filled in the source box. Hit Start and it will now boot from the live ISO/CD/DVD. When the live environment finishes loading, click the install icon on the desktop to begin the installer. The installation process is just the same as if you were installing to the computer normally. When asked if you want to \"Erase disk and install\", it is NOT going to erase your real hard drive - it is talking about the virtual hard drive. (Same thing if you choose 'Something else' and partition the drive manually.) After install is complete, reboot the VM. If the installation disk appears to be stuck and not rebooting, click your mouse somewhere inside the VM window, then hit the ENTER key. If nothing happens, click the \"x\" on the VM window and choose to Shutdown the machine. Then just highlight the VM and hit the Start arrow again. In the VM, you can do much the same as when installed for real on your computer. You can install things, download updates, etc., and it all happens within the virtual environment on the virtual HDD. Whenever you want to shutdown a running VM, shutdown using the normal shutdown method of the OS in the VM - not by closing the VM window. (If the VM OS was Linux Lite, you would click Menu, Logout, Shutdown, just like on your computer.) Using USB's in VirtualBox Assuming you've already added the the VirtualBox Extension Pack to begin using USB's in your new VM, you need to add your username to the vboxusers group. (You only need to do that once, not for every individual VM you make.) You should perform the following steps while no VM's are open. Open the Linux Lite (not VirtualBox) Settings Manager, Menu, Settings, Settings Manager and select the Lite User Manager. With your username showing under Select user, scroll down the list in the Groups column and place a check in the box next to vboxusers to add yourself to that group and hit Apply. Close out Lite User Manager, the Settings Manager and any other open programs. Reboot the computer, then log back in for the new setting to take effect. Open VirtualBox and start your new VM. Once up and running you will see a little USB icon along bottom right edge of the VirtualBox window. Right-click on it to choose the USB you want to use. Additional VirtualBox Information Sources: VirtualBox Homepage VirtualBox User Manual VirtualBox Help Forums Top of page File Search File search is an easy to use GUI file search utility found under Menu, Accessories, File search. Upon opening File search, you will see this file search window: Click the 3-dots icon in upper-right corner and choose Refresh search index. Now click on the Unlock button. Enter your password. File search uses the locate command to search for files. The locate command relies on a database it maintains of the files on your computer. That database gets automatically updated periodically - normally once a day. Before conducting a search it is a good idea to manually update the database index to make sure that any file changes made since the last update are reflected in the search results. Update complete. You can also use the 3-dots button for other options like displaying advanced settings in the search window. The advanced settings display lets you filter search results by file modification dates, file types, file extensions, etc. The example below shows a search in my Home folder for any file with car in the file name. To limit the results to only txt files, simply click Documents under File Type in the advanced settings. Top of page ","tags":"","url":"tutorials.html"},
